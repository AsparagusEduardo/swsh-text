Y-Comm
Y-Comm offers many ways to connect with other players! You’ll be welcome to swap Pokémon, take part in Pokémon battles, and more! There’s never a shortage of things to do!
This is called a stamp. Your stamps will be sent to others when you open up the Y-Comm menu and choose one of the options there to try to connect with your fellow Trainers! Stamps come with messages, too, so everyone can understand just what you’re interested in.
Normally, you can use Y-Comm to connect with people close-by. But if you press the + Button and connect to the internet, you’ll be able to connect with people around the world!
When stamps arrive in Y-Comm while you’re out on your adventure, it means that other Trainers are around and looking for someone to connect with. Press the Y Button to see who’s around!
Select a stamp that shows the silhouette of a Pokémon on it, and you’ll be able to team up with your fellow Trainers to battle Pokémon!
Pokémon League Cards
Show off your achievements by making a League Card! You can customize your card using the Card Maker found at every Pokémon Center. Doing so will also update your card with all your latest information!
Trainers all have their own League Cards, and you can swap cards with other Trainers that you connect with using communication features. You can view all the League Cards you’ve collected by checking out your album, which you can find in the League Card option of the X menu.
From the X menu, you can select League Card and then Album to view the League Cards you’ve received. This is also where you’ll find League Cards you received from other players!
The Battle Stadium
In the Battle Stadium, you can connect to other Trainers around the world to take part in Link Battles and various battle competitions against one another.
Casual Battles let you easily connect with all kinds of other players for battles—and for a bit of fun! You might see some unexpected Pokémon and moves being used in these easygoing battles.
Ranked Battles are the real deal. This is where serious Trainers go to take one another on and try to reach the highest ranks. Your rank shows how strong your team is, and it can go up and down based on the results of your battles.
Online Competitions use a different system to measure your skill as a Trainer. Here you earn a number rating that shows where you stand among the competition. For a fixed period of time, you’ll battle numerous other Trainers, and those battles will make your rating go up or down. Unlike other battle modes, it’s up to you to search out and select a competition you’ll choose to take part in.
The Dynamax Phenomenon
In the Galar region, Pokémon can become far larger than usual in certain places. This transformation is called “Dynamaxing.” Press the [VAR FF00(0006)]Dynamax button [VAR FF00(0000)]when your Dynamax Band lights up to Dynamax your Pokémon.
Your Pokémon can only Dynamax for [VAR FF00(0006)]three turns[VAR FF00(0000)]! During that time, your Dynamax Pokémon can use extremely powerful moves known as [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Moves[VAR FF00(0000)]. These Max Moves not only deal tremendous damage— they can also trigger special effects! The exact effect changes depending on the type of the move used. Choose carefully when to Dynamax your Pokémon, and smash your way to victory!
Pokémon Camp
In your Pokémon Camp, you and your Pokémon can play together and even eat together, growing closer through the experience! If your Pokémon grow very close to you, they may even try extra hard for you during battle!
You can play using your Joy-Con, too! If you slide your Joy-Con off your system, you can wave one about to throw a ball for your Pokémon to retrieve or wave a Poké Toy for their delight. If you waggle that Poké Toy, you might even entice Pokémon hanging out farther back in your camp to come play!
When you set up camp in the Wild Area, you’ll be able to play with up to three other Trainers at a time. All kinds of people and Pokémon might stumble upon your camp, even those you’ve never met before, so get to know them as you play together!
Cooking at Camp
Cook up a fine curry while out camping by selecting ingredients and Berries of your liking! Your curries will get more delicious if you choose to do things like using rare ingredients or adding lots of Berries, too.
Once you start cooking, fan the flames with your fan to keep things hot enough, and stir things up with your ladle to keep ’em moving. Only don’t go overboard— you don’t want to spill! The last step will be to add a bit of soul into it at just the right timing, and you’ll have made a masterpiece for your Pokémon to enjoy!
After you finish cooking, it’ll be time for everyone to dig in together. Eating a tasty curry can have a number of effects on the Pokémon that are at your camp, including restoring their HP and making them feel more friendly toward you!
[~ 34]
Pokémon Dens
The pillars of red light you’ll see in the Wild Area mark Pokémon Dens. Dynamax Pokémon dwell in these dens, and you’ll be able to battle them by investigating the den. You can start the battle on your own or get up to three other players to help you out!
If you throw Wishing Chips into Pokémon Dens that don’t have a light pillar, Dynamax Pokémon can appear in them, too! Try throwing a Wishing Chip into a Pokémon Den you come across and see what happens!
You will also find Pokémon Dens that are glowing red but do not have the light pillar. Checking these dens will reward you with Watts! You can give Watts to Trainers around the Wild Area to receive lots of different items.
Max Raid Battles
Defeat a Dynamax Pokémon, and you’ll get a chance at catching it! Additionally, there are some rare items that you can only obtain by battling Dynamax Pokémon!
When wild Pokémon Dynamax, they become incredibly powerful. They may unleash multiple moves in a row and take other actions you won’t see in a regular battle. Working together with other Trainers will be key as you take on these Dynamax Pokémon together as a team of four.
The Flying Taxis
If you use the Flying Taxi service, one of their well-trained Corviknight will have you zipping across the Galar region to your desired destination in no time at all! Just open up the X menu, and use the Town Map to choose where you want to go!
[~ 44]
Pokémon Boxes
You can keep extra Pokémon in your Pokémon Boxes. You’ve got your own Boxes in the Pokémon storage system, which you can access at the Rotom Information terminals (Rotomi) found in Pokémon Centers everywhere. You can retrieve Pokémon from your Boxes at any Rotomi you visit, too!
Press the X Button to toggle between different modes so you can organize your Boxes more easily. You can move Pokémon between your party and your Boxes, or sort the Pokémon in your Boxes based on a number of different criteria.
Press the Y Button, and you can change what happens as you select Pokémon. The red cursor gives you detailed options for a single Pokémon. The blue cursor lets you move or select a Pokémon easily. And the green cursor lets you outline a rectangular area so you can move several Pokémon at once.

[~ 51]
Poké Jobs
Pokémon are in high demand as helpers in the Galar region, and you’re able to send your own Pokémon out to help out on jobs! The Pokémon you send out will grow stronger from the experience they gain!
The job postings will be updated every day. Good things will begin to happen if you send lots of Pokémon to many jobs, so keep an eye out for new postings and help out as much as you can!
Job postings are updated just once a day, but as you get better evaluations, you’ll find that the number of job postings available will increase! Sending a job requester lots of the type of Pokémon they’re seeking will get you a great evaluation, so choose Pokémon that are best suited to each job!
[~ 56]
The Gym Challenge
The Gym Challenge is an event in which aspiring Trainers travel around the Galar region to try to collect Gym Badges from eight of its Gyms. To earn a Gym Badge, you have to complete that Gym’s mission and also defeat its Gym Leader.
Live Competitions
Live Competitions let you gather together with others and have competitions with one another. These can be casual Friendly Competitions, which are hosted among friends, or Official Competitions. If you want to find out about current or upcoming Official Competitions, check out Pokémon’s official website.
Hosting a Competition
Live Competitions can be hosted by anyone— including you! Set up the rules you’d like everyone to battle with, and then you can share them with all your competition participants using your system’s communication features! For more information, head to Pokémon’s official website!
Casual Battles
Please observe the following rules when taking part in Casual Battles: • Battle Teams must be made up of [VAR FF00(0006)]six different Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]. • No two Pokémon can [VAR FF00(0006)]hold the same item[VAR FF00(0000)].
You can take part in Casual Battles even with special Pokémon in your Battle Team. Enjoy battles with all your favorite Pokémon!
Ranked Battles
Please observe the following rules when taking part in Ranked Battles: • Battle Teams must be made up of [VAR FF00(0006)]six different Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]. • No two Pokémon can [VAR FF00(0006)]hold the same item[VAR FF00(0000)]. • Teams must not contain[VAR FF00(0006)] any special Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)].
You’ll earn or lose points based on the results of your Ranked Battles. Once you’ve gained a certain number of points from your Ranked Battles, you’ll go up in rank. On the other hand, if you lose enough points, you’ll go down in rank.
Ranks are sorted into different tiers. Once you reach a new tier, you won’t fall back down into a lower tier, even if you lose in your Ranked Battles. For example, once you’ve reached the Ultra Ball Tier, you won’t fall back down into the Great Ball Tier, regardless of how many battles you lose.
Ranked Battles are held during set periods. Each of these set periods is called a season. Once one season ends, a new season will begin. When a new season begins, all players will have their ranks lowered. At this time only, you might find that you’ve moved down a tier.
The players who reach the highest rank in Ranked Battles will no longer battle to reach a higher rank, but instead to see where they place among the best. A Trainer’s place in the highest rank will go up or down based on the results of their battles.
Online Competitions
Online Competitions can be broken down into two categories: Official Competitions and Friendly Competitions.
In Official Competitions, you take part in special battles with a variety of different rules and restrictions in order to see where you place. Details about the schedule for these competitions and restrictions on what Pokémon you can use in them are announced on Pokémon’s official website.
Friendly Competitions are competitions that are held by players themselves. These are casual battles where players come together to battle one another. You can try your hand at plenty of Friendly Competitions!
Search for an Official Competition or a Friendly Competition, and enter one to take part in battles once the competition begins. Search out competitions with rules that sound like a fun challenge or that allow you to take part with the Pokémon you like!
The Pokémon Box Link
You can use the Pokémon Box Link to access your Pokémon Boxes while you’re on the road. You’ll be able to add Pokémon to your party or transfer Pokémon from your party to a Box. You can access your Boxes by selecting Pokémon from the X menu and then pressing the R Button.
Information about Ranked Battles
Select VS from the menu and then select Battle Stadium to participate in Ranked Battles! Hone your skills at the Battle Tower, and then give it a try!
Fishing
If you see shadows in the water, you’ll likely find Pokémon lurking beneath them. Face such a shadow and press the A Button to cast your line and try to fish up a catch! If your Fishing Rod shakes, press the A Button once more to reel in a Pokémon. Try fishing wherever you spot these shadows!
[~ 83]
Rental Teams
Rental Teams allow you to borrow other people’s Battle Teams that they’ve shared over the internet, or you can share your own team so other players can see how great it is! When a team is shared, it will be given a team ID. Input that team ID when searching for a Rental Team, and you’ll be able to borrow the associated Battle Team!
The Isle of Armor
You have an Armor Pass! Show it to the rail staff at Wedgehurst Station if you want to visit the Isle of Armor. You’ll be able to set out on a new adventure where you can catch rare Pokémon and grow with your team!
The Crown Tundra
You have a Crown Pass! Show it to the rail staff at Wedgehurst Station if you want to visit the Crown Tundra, a land where many mysteries lurk within. New adventures await there, and the blanketing snow hides Legendary Pokémon of yore!
Dynamax Adventure
Form a team of four Trainers, and set off to explore the mysterious Max Lair. See if you can find the Legendary Pokémon said to await you in the deepest part of this unusual den!
To take part in a Dynamax Adventure, you must borrow a single Pokémon to accompany you. Get things started by having each Trainer select the Pokémon they will take with them on their adventure.
As you explore this den, you’ll come to branches in your path. Decide as a team which way to go. When you come across a Dynamax Pokémon, it’ll be time for a Max Raid Battle! Catch the Pokémon, and you can swap it with the one you have if you think it’ll help you press on into the depths of the den.
The King of Bountiful Harvests
There’s a fairy tale in Freezington about the Legendary Pokémon known as the King of Bountiful Harvests. In the legends, the king is said to wear a massive crown on its head, but the wooden statue near the fields in the middle of the village shows no sign of a crown.
Calyrex appeared once I placed the crown on the statue of the King of Bountiful Harvests. Calyrex can apparently speak to humans by taking over a person’s body—Peony’s, in this case. Now I need to gather more information on the King of Bountiful Harvests from the people of the village!
In order to find the king’s beloved steed, I’ll need to first get my hands on its favorite food—carrots. Maybe the people of Freezington can help me out.
Upon hearing that I was able to find Carrot Seeds, Calyrex told me about two fields where I can grow the carrots. I need to pick either the field covered in snow or the field by the graves and plant the seeds!
Calyrex was able to grow an Iceroot Carrot from the seeds I planted in the field covered in snow! The scent of the carrot lured Glastrier out, but it ran off toward Freezington.
Calyrex was able to grow a Shaderoot Carrot from the seeds I planted in the field by the graves! The scent of the carrot lured Spectrier out, but it ran off toward Freezington.
Using the mane hair I got by defeating the Pokémon that was once the king’s loyal steed along with the Radiant Petal grown by Calyrex itself, I was able to re-create the Reins of Unity! Now I need to head to the Crown Shrine, where the steed’s been living, to meet up with Calyrex!
Calyrex, the King of Bountiful Harvests, was able to reconnect with its loyal steed using the new Reins of Unity. Calyrex also seems to have regained its trust in humankind. As thanks for helping it regain its power, Calyrex is allowing me to take it along on my adventure!
The Legendary Giants

Far, far into the Giant’s Bed lies a temple where the giant of stone sleeps. On the temple’s door are strange words: [VAR FF00(0006)]“Let the first Pokémon hold a never-changing stone.” When I gave my Pokémon an Everstone to hold, the door opened—and I found Regirock.[VAR FF00(0000)]

On the distant paths of Three-Point Pass lies a temple where two giants sleep. On the temple’s door are strange words: “Whe... ... ...ree ... ... ...door... ... ...all be ... ...ened.” The door remains firmly shut.
On the distant paths of Three-Point Pass lies a temple where two giants sleep. On the temple’s door are strange words: [VAR FF00(0006)]“When gather the three giants, the door of destiny shall be opened.” With the giants of stone, ice, and steel gathered, the door opened—and I chose a giant.[VAR FF00(0000)]

You encountered a scientist!
Is your Pokémon feeling a bit worn out from your adventure?
I have a rental Pokémon here that I could swap with someone. I only have one, though.
Are you interested in swapping your current Pokémon for another rental Pokémon?
In that case... [VAR 0189(0000)]! I guess I’ll let you borrow my [VAR 0101(0001)] this time!

It’s common manners for Pokémon Trainers to battle when their eyes meet.
Whenever there’s a strong Trainer, I always look right at them...
If you don’t want to battle, it’s important to make sure you aren’t seen by other people when you’re walking around.
I couldn’t beat Hop, but I’m gonna beat you!
Lose to wild Pokémon... Lose to many Trainers...
Pokémon hiding in the tall grass or Trainers waiting along the route—which one you choose is up to you!
Cute and strong, together in combination!
Are we cute and nothing more? It looks like our strength still has a ways to go...
Pokémon have types. Fire is strong against Grass, Grass is strong against Water, and Water is strong against Fire. Remember that, and you’ll get really strong!
Young Pokémon Trainer, won’t you honor me with a battle?
Oho? It seems you’re already quite used to Pokémon battles...
I’m someone who can’t help but look forward to seeing how strong you’ll get. I’ll support you from now on!
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
[~ 17]
You saw the opening ceremony, right? Then you know why I’m excited and want to battle!
I lost! But I’m still excited!
I’m gonna participate in the Gym Challenge next year!
I’ve been studying foreign languages, computers, and Pokémon!
What?! I lost... My Pokémon savvy wasn’t enough?
I should find even more about Pokémon to like— that way, I’ll learn more about them. Like how if you lower their HP, they get easier to catch!
Oh! Instead of a Pokémon, I found a Trainer! I’ll have to check how strong you are!
Yeowch! Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare way too strong!
Losing’s really painful, so I’ll raise my partner Pokémon, too!
Were you thinking of passing through without even looking at my Pokémon?
Win or lose, I don’t mind! I just wanted to show off my Pokémon!
If we’re talking who’s poured more love into their Pokémon, I’m clearly the winner!
I’ll show you what I carry! Letters and victory!
Turns out I was carrying your victory.
Letters filled with thoughts and emotions... One must carry them gently.
Every Pokémon’s got a type or two. And every type has strong points and weak ones.
I’m weak to people older than me...
Try switching Pokémon when you’ve got a bad matchup in battle!
My work partner and I are in perfect sync even in battle!
Hmm. Looks like we weren’t in sync...
We’re in perfect sync when we work together, though...
Working women are good at Pokémon battles, too!
Your Pokémon... I want to scout [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem!
Working Pokémon have a special something that really shines!
In order to do good work, I can’t slack off on training!
You made for some good training.
Training is important in all things. Persevering with your training is even more important!
I was looking around for items, but I found a Trainer.
If only I’d used an item effectively when I was in a pinch.
Use items you pick up. They’re like a gift from someone.
I’m doing special training while camping to train my Pokémon! The finishing touch will be a battle with you!
I was sure my Pokémon were in top condition...
My special training... I played and ate so much tasty food, and it didn’t even work?
Fifty years of raising Pokémon! Did you come to see the progress of my work?
Well, I didn’t raise them for 50 years.
I see! Even if Pokémon are in top shape, if the Breeder is really just a beginner, it’s tough to win!
What do you think? I look just like a Pikachu, right?
Pikaaa?!
I thought it’d be a really good strategy to distract you by having you think both the Trainer and the Pokémon were Pikachu...
I’m an Eevee! I’m full of possibilities!
I’m an Eevee... I’m downhearted because I lost.
I’m an Eevee! When I grow up, what type of Pokémon do you think I’ll evolve into?
Appearing with a “Pika!”
I’m so downhearted...
I’ll go take a kip and rest comfortably inside a Poké Ball!
OK, now I say, “A wild Poké Kid appeared!”
Oh... It’s already over.
I dress like this because I want to understand the feelings of Pokémon.
Welcome, Gym Challenger! Sorry, but I’ll have to send you packing. It’s my job.
As expected! A Gym Challenger and their Pokémon are in perfect sync with each other!
Whoa! When you beat a Gym Trainer, the Gym’s Yamper will stand still for a bit. Which means your Gym mission gets a tad easier!
I wonder if your Pokémon want[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s to use [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir moves with all [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir strength and feel great.
I’ll give a “bow wark” instead of Yamper!
Youth! Open the gate! Seize the future!
The Gym Leader lies just ahead of you! But that doesn’t mean you’ll be reaching him.
Next is the Gym Leader, right? What a strong challenger...
Many Gym Challengers come here to battle, but...there’s something that really shines about you!
’Ello, ’ello, what’s all this then? Fancy a scrap with a copper?
You’ve got some Pokémon with you there. Your battle technique is bang on, too!
You should have no problems traveling alone. I’ve seen enough to know you can handle yourself.
Time for a special interview with a Gym Challenger! The best way to get to know you is a Pokémon battle, of course!
Since I’m gathering information, you should bring at least two Pokémon.
It’s hard to describe it in just a few words— what incredible potential!
With your strength, you’re sure to keep winning during your Gym Challenge! Please let me get an interview again sometime!
Good Pokémon and Trainers really shine on-camera!
You need at least two Pokémon to take me on.
I lost! Does that mean the interview is ruined?
Your Pokémon look great even when I view them through the camera!
I’d like to show you my Pokémon that have grown so well.
I wasn’t sure which moves to use and got lost in thought.
I was chased by Pokémon in the tall grass and ended up wandering aimlessly.
Oho! I found a Trainer whilst gathering Berries!
I should have given my Pokémon a Berry when its HP got low...
Different Pokémon love different Berries, so you’ve got to gather a lot of different kinds!
My partner Pokémon’s been growing in a really unique way. Check it out.
Pokémon are living creatures after all. You can’t always raise them how you want.
Raising Pokémon unselfishly means that they’ll show you their new capabilities.
Keep this to yourself, but... I’m having Pokémon help with my work.
You’re a Trainer who’s stronger than me and the Pokémon that can do my work.
When I get stuck with my work, I have my Pokémon pet me.
Work to raise the good points of a Pokémon. Don’t...don’t worry about its bad points.
I’ll accept that I lost, but I’m not gonna let it bother me that much.
More than focusing on what you can’t do, it’s important to enjoy what you can do in life!
Welcome to Hulbury Stadium! Ready to bask in the beauty of Water-type moves?
Huh? Tympole and I were the ones who got soaked?
A battle between you and Gym Leader Nessa is sure to excite Gym Challenge fans!
Pressing a button stops the water...but you’ve got to think about the order, too.
I wasn’t sure about the right thing to do in that battle...
The order of the buttons... There’s only one right order to press them all in.
What? You made it this far? And you want to... battle me?
With that strength, it’s no wonder you beat me and my Pokémon...
Usually the last Trainer in a Gym is pretty strong, but I don’t have a lot of confidence, so they let me stay back here...
When I’m tired of work, it’s time for a battle! I’ll show you the muscles I’ve built up!
The muscles I use for work and for battle are different!
This is just something I overheard, but... Two Pokémon of the same species can have different strengths!
My Pokémon is bursting with energy. What I mean to say is...please battle me!
A loss is a loss! My Pokémon lost its energy, too!
When you’ve got too much energy, you need to let those feelings out. Battles are a good way to do that.
Steam power can send any opponent flying!
What incredible power! Guess I was the one sent flying.
Railways were built all across the Galar region a long time ago when the steam engine was built.
My supercute Pokémon is interested in your Pokémon.
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare way too strong! You’ll be safe no matter where you go.
My supercute Clefairy can evolve by using some kind of stone, I think!
Battling is important to better understand Pokémon.
We want to see more than one Pokémon.
Ah! I just get so, so, so concerned when I see injured Pokémon.
The world would be a better place if there was no need for doctors.
Time for a checkup!
I want to check lots of Pokémon. Two! Bring at least two!
What is real strength? I’m very curious!
A strong Trainer understands their Pokémon better than anyone else in the world.
I came from far away to watch the Gym Challenge. I’d love the opportunity to battle a Gym Challenger.
Muy dramático! Fantástico!
The Gym Challenge sure looks tough. You can’t get ahead if you don’t win. I think we’ll just continue our carefree journey.
A model who’s also strong in battle—that’s who I am.
Even if I lose who I am, the charm of Pokémon will never fade.
Even compared to Pokémon, I should still stand out... Probably!
Are you making curry? Are you filling your Curry Dex?
The strength of you and your Pokémon has made my mouth go numb!
I’m so hooked on the Curry Dex that gathering ingredients has become the main focus of my travels!
Pokémon is art, too, if we both give it our all!
Your moves were beautiful... Oh my, I’m completely fascinated by them.
The greatest art is drawn from Pokémon and their Trainer in a battle!
You look pretty dizzy. Are you sure you can battle in that condition?
I’m dizzy... No, I’m completely dazzled. What an incredible battle!
You have something special in you. Bring out your wonderful talent.
Our Gym mission is like a theme-park attraction! What do you think?
What a formidable battle style! I can feel a good sense of balance coming from you.
I purposely spin around to get myself dizzy. That way, I can train my balance.
Our job is to defeat all the reckless Gym Challengers!
Thank you for reminding me of what it was like to be a Gym Challenger!
I want to support strong Gym Challengers! Keep winning through to the end!
Spin the teacups too much, and Gym Challengers go flying!
I lost. My consciousness has been sent flying.
Gym Challenger! Just how high will you fly? Don’t tie yourself down.
Back and forth, back and forth—you’re spinning. Back and forth, back and forth—me too.
Losing made me remember...the Gym Leader wears a mask...
Beneath the Gym Leader’s mask... What does he look like? I wonder...
Can you understand what Ghost-type Pokémon are weak to? I don’t think so.
If you understand type matchups, it’s only natural that it’d be easier to win.
Even if you don’t hit weaknesses, it’s fine as long as you win, right?
Are you looking for mushrooms? They give off light when you touch them!
Hey, a strong Trainer! That’s rarer than rare mushrooms!
It’s said that there’re some rare mushrooms in Glimwood Tangle, so I’m hoping to make some good curry if I find any.
Some mushrooms react in interesting ways when you touch them.
Madames like me react in sad ways when we’re defeated...
Mushrooms that you touch will start glowing... But their glowing dims as time goes by.
The railways are amazing! They can carry lots of people and Pokémon at once!
One’s not enough! I like a battle with lots of Pokémon.
A good way to forget the trouble of this loss would be to ride the train.
The railways are amazing! Watching the scenery rush by out the window and arriving at the station... What an incredible time!
I came to ride a Galar train... I wonder if meeting you will change my life.
A battle with lots of Pokémon! Bring at least two Pokémon!
Too strong... Guess I’ll look for someone I can actually beat...
There are lots of people more and less amazing than you, so don’t mind others too much.
As a model, I’ll show off the appeal of my partner Pokémon!
What a great Trainer you are! You really showed off the appeal of your partner Pokémon.
I want to become someone everyone wants to be like...just like the Champion!
Being a taxi driver means I’ve got to be ready anytime, anywhere. Pokémon battles are the same...anytime, anywhere.
No matter where I go in my taxi, loss and loneliness seem to follow...
One of the troubling things about being a driver is that sometimes Corviknight will take off and forget the customer.
I acknowledge your strength. Please indulge me in a contest of strength and wits.
Ah, see? Exactly as I had thought.
To live without making enemies... That is the way of a gentleman.
I shall now closely examine the health of your Pokémon.
When Pokémon aren’t healthy, it drags our mood down, too.
When people are healthy, they tend not to realize how valuable that health is.
You can compare life to a journey, but the end of your life isn’t the same as a journey’s goal.
Even if you fail, it’s not the end. You can stand up and fight back.
I’ve met and battled many Gym Challengers. I hope everyone reaches their goals.
My live concert is open to all, and you’ll be attending!
Hmm, guess the rhythm between me and my partner was off.
One day...I really want to jam with Piers...
Succeeding as a businessman depends on communication. I get along perfectly with my Pokémon!
This should be special, so show me at least two Pokémon!
I’ll sell this victory to you! I’m short on pocket change!
Let me check my schedule! There’s nothing to be gained by fretting over a loss!
I’m super cute, but I’m carrying superduper-strong Pokémon!
Seriously? Only one Pokémon? I don’t want to battle you like that.
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare strong AND cute?!
I’m strong and cute, so Pokémon that are strong and cute suit me best.
Gym Challenger, if it’s all right, I will be your training partner.
My Pokémon did their best but they couldn’t compete! Good luck in the future!
A long time ago, police officers used to ride on horse Pokémon.
Hey, you used to walking around in Circhester Stadium yet?
You battled so confidently... I see! You’ve got to have confidence!
The trick to walking around here is to be careful but confidently press on straight forward. That should work.
Rock types are really, really, really, really amazing!
Did I...make you understand how amazing Rock types are?
Rock types have higher Sp. Def during a sandstorm—they become super tough. That’s why they’re amazing!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number one! He’s cool and fashionable!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number two! He’s lively and stylish!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number three! He’s popular with girls! Ugh! I want to be like that!
Gym Challenger! I know you’re there.
Even though I knew you were there, I couldn’t see a path to victory.
The path you will follow... I see that it’s a road of victory.
As long as I’ve got Ice-type Pokémon with me, I can stay totally chill.
What?! There’s no way I could lose!
As long as I’ve got Ice-type Pokémon with me, I can stay totally chill...
Gym Challenger, I’ll freeze you and your Pokémon solid and shatter you into tiny pieces.
I got smashed to tiny pieces...along with my pride...
Ice types don’t freeze! They have a lot of weaknesses, but I won’t stop loving them.
Gym Challenger, are you aiming to battle Melony, too?
Oh no! She might get cross at me if she hears I lost to a challenger.
Melony is merciless when she battles to ensure that she’ll win. It’s not a fighting style that everyone likes, but that’s all right.
Continue forward, even if you can’t see where you’re going. That’s Circhester Stadium’s Gym mission.
Just like you won because you believed in your Pokémon, believe in yourself and move forward.
Don’t get careless. I thought I’d reached the end when I suddenly fell in a pit.
Meeting a Trainer can only mean battle! What a simple concept.
The stronger one always wins. How simple...
See the image and cast your line. It’s simple... That means it’s profound...
My Pokémon are all pumped up from dancing with me. Are you ready for us?
Wow! You and your Pokémon make a combo that throws out moves like an elegant dance!
I want my Pokémon to learn some moves that are like dancing.
Witness the results of the training I did together with Pokémon!
Hiyah! I lost! Looks like I’ll need more training!
If I give it everything I got, then maybe I’ll be able to beat the Champion... Maybe.
Aim for your opponent’s weak spots, and strike! That’s all there is to it.
To use four moves... That’s all it should take!
I heard that a long time ago there was a great detective in Galar who used a martial art called baritsu...
Whether it’s fishing or Pokémon battles, type matchups are important!
Losing with a spiky Pokémon makes my heart feel prickly.
No matter how good you are at fishing, if you try to fish where there are no Pokémon, you won’t find anything!
I’ve finished all my warm-ups! OK, let’s battle with everything we’ve got!
I got tired from the warm-ups. My Pokémon and I gave it too much.
Doing things in moderation is important, but it just doesn’t feel satisfying.
Swimming trains muscles! Muscles launch moves!
To deal with the shock of losing, I’m going to swim far, far away.
There are swimming experts who can swim all the way to the Kalos region.
I’m all rested up, so how about you be my opponent?
I’m a mermaid... I want to return to the ocean...
I was looking for Berries to let my Pokémon hold.
I’m doing research to see if one day I can swim anywhere with my beloved Toxapex.
Is this the limit of Water types? No, I can still come up with more!
I wonder if I added a fin to a swimsuit, would I be able to swim faster? But Toxapex doesn’t really swim all that often.
Sing! Dance! Let’s make this a party hall!
I always end up singing a depressing song when I lose...
If Pokémon and moves are mixed in, too, we’ll have an amazing vibe!
Who cares about losing... Guess I’ll just sing an annoying song.
If I dance, I shine! My Pokémon shines brighter, too!
It’s a team, so it’d be better if you had at least two Pokémon!
Dancing is the best way to stay healthy!
I wouldn’t have lost if it was a dance battle! We should both focus on our strengths.
Do you have any injured Pokémon? I’m a doctor.
What’s this, what’s this? My Pokémon ended up injured.
A strong Trainer like you has probably seen many injured Pokémon... Must be pretty tough.
Only do what you can. Taking risks while mountain climbing is dangerous.
You won’t be able to beat a strong opponent without pushing the limits of what’s possible.
Slowly increasing what you can do is a good way to level yourself up.
Waha! A Pokémon Trainer! What should I do? I don’t really want to battle.
I think I got mixed up somewhere around my first Pokémon.
I lost, but there was a lot that I learned. So in that way, I actually won!
The post... I wonder just how long we can keep on carrying letters like this.
I lost... When I think about it... I didn’t want it to ever end!
The feelings of letters only gain meaning after they are delivered to people. Even if it was the last letter ever sent, I’d carry it no matter what!
Do you know the old legend that says that Galar is doomed if Corviknight ever disappear?
I actually don’t know much about the old Corviknight legend...
I pride myself on my strong Corviknight that carries customers while flying.
I get more nervous about battles than work...
When I do business, I’m called a businessman. So when I battle, should I be called a battleman?
Being together with Pokémon... It’s really amazing if you think about it.
[~ 280]
[~ 281]
[~ 282]
The way you carry yourself... You are something!
Oh! Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare simply marvelous!
In Galar, we’ve shown our dear Pokémon to each other and shown respect to each other since ancient times.
It’s been a while! I’m glad we could meet up again. Let’s see how strong you’ve gotten.
Since I’m gathering information, you should bring at least two Pokémon.
What strength! I’m at a loss for words... Nice work, everyone!
If you win the Gym Challenge, I’ll be requesting an exclusive interview.
Great Pokémon and Trainers really shine with something special when they’re on-camera!
You need at least two Pokémon to take me on.
I lost! But it’s all right. I was able to assess your strength.
I can’t stop watching your Pokémon from through the camera lens! They’ve got some kind of aura about them!
The power of Grass has wilted... What an incredible Gym Challenger!
I may proudly be the strongest member of this Gym, but I was totally washed away!
[VAR 1101(00FD,0103)]A gGreat Pokémon and a great Trainer! It’s no surprise that you won!
You beat my two Pokémon with your one?! You and that Grookey are too much!
You beat my two Pokémon with your one?! You and that Scorbunny are too much!
You beat my two Pokémon with your one?! You and that Sobble are too much!
Oof! Gutted that I lost... But I’d expect nothing less from my rival!
Oof! Gutted that I lost... But I’d expect nothing less from my rival!
Oof! Gutted that I lost... But I’d expect nothing less from my rival!
Went lookin’ for a fight, and I lost... I’m so pathetic...
I came to see the Gym Challenge openin’ ceremony, but this is awful!
You and your Pokémon broke through!
I wasn’t able...to properly greet you.
I lost! My leg pain’s back, so it’s a double shock!
Huh? Seriously? You’ve gotta be kiddin’... It’s over already? Wha—?!
It would’ve been better if you’d just lost to us...
Did I lose as a member of Team Yell? Or was I beaten as a Gym Trainer?
We both got ourselves the same Grass Badge, so how come you’re so much stronger?!
We both got ourselves the same Grass Badge, so how come you’re so much stronger?!

I felt the fighting spirit of your Pokémon as you led [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem in battle.
I nearly lost my mask from the shock... That was...wow. I can see your skill for what it is.
This has to be some kind of mistake. I demand a do-over.
Your pink is still lacking, but you’re an excellent Trainer with [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]ansome excellent Pokémon.

I just want to climb into a hole... Well, I guess it’d be more like falling from here, right?
*sigh* I wanna go back to Spikemuth. I really do.
What’s with that?! My Pokémon didn’t get a chance to really do their thing at all. Ugh!
I might have lost, but I still look good. Maybe I should snap a quick selfie...
OK, so I lost... But I got to see a lot of the good points of you and your Pokémon!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Thanks, mate. I’m really glad you were the one here with me.

*sigh* I wasn’t able to win... Oleana...you really are a hopeless woman.
I couldn’t win, but at least I was able to show everyone how great Fairy types are.

I’d forgotten how great Pokémon battles are! It’s been so long since I battled... That sure was satisfying.
My time as Champion is over... But what a champion time it’s been! Thank you for the greatest battle I’ve ever had!
If you stand your ground with everything you got, it doesn’t matter what’s right or wrong.
To be cautious and wary—that’s the trick to survival.
I play a strong Trainer. I’m a method actor, so I became a Trainer in real life, too.

Doubles... There’s a lot to think about with them. It makes them difficult, but fun, too!
The weather is fickle! Victory and defeat are even more fickle!
Cooperation between Trainers and their Pokémon just brings out their strength even more!
Team Yell’s supposed to be helping out, but they just don’t know when to quit...
I wasn’t sure if it was better to try to mess with your head or concentrate on your Pokémon. And I was the one who ended up losing focus.
Did I lose as a member of Team Yell? Or was I beaten as a Gym Trainer?
You handle the rest! I’ll leave ’em to you! I’m sure you can handle this!

Blimey, even your battles are too noisy...
Ugh! Why d’you ’ave to be such a bother?!
You had no problem handling our surging might. It’s no wonder that you won.
Your strength nearly made me want to turn and run in my bare feet!
Maybe my mask...kept me from seeing just how strong you really are...
Losing in the Finals is pretty rough, but I suppose I’d better take a quick shot to remember it by...
I didn’t expect there to be such a gap between you and me, mate...

Dynamaxing is all brute strength, no strat... That’s why I hate it!
It’s frustratin’ that we weren’t able to go toe-to-toe with a Dynamax Pokémon for longer...
That was an impressive Dynamax... It washed me clean away!
Galar’s in trouble. Why am I wasting time like this?!
Surely this must be some kind of mistake... Wouldn’t you say, Younger Brother?
Tch... Quite the vexing predicament indeed, Older Brother!
Sorry, mate! You’ve gotta take it from here!

It’s time to prove I’m a notch above the competition to everyone in the Galar region. Though I suppose everyone should know by now.
Why did I have the misfortune of being born in the same time period as you...?
If it weren’t for you, then I could prove beyond doubt that I am the best... Still, I do enjoy my battles with you...to a degree.
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the Gym Challenge! You’re the great Champion, after all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted... You’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym Challengers aiming for your title. I can’t wait to see what talent grows!
I’m sure you remember, but I’m Nessa. And I’m not here to chat. I’m here to win!
I just don’t get it. What do I gotta do to beat you, huh?
I have my best team, and we train and we train... But then you’re always just one step ahead. Maybe that’s why I can’t stop thinking about you.
A tournament that ends when you lose! Whoever can keep up the heat will win!
[VAR 1101(00FD,0103)]A gGood Pokémon and a great Trainer! It’s no surprise that you won!
I really enjoy battling you. It’s a great way for me to feel my own growth! And I plan to keep growing and battling, until I become an old coot that nobody can beat!
Focusing too much on winning can cause one to make mistakes. I will face you with a clear head!
Your Pokémon... They’re so strong, they’re practically dizzying!
I want to achieve so many different things during battles. It’s hard to decide sometimes... I still have much to learn.
...Let’s start the match.
I’m glad I had my mask... I was making quite the face just now...
...The only reason I can battle in front of so many people without completely losing my cool is thanks to you, Champion. Battles with you are so absorbing that they simply make me forget myself or where I am.
Well, it’s a pleasure to have a chance to play with you again. No quizzes this time! I’m going all out!
You’re starting to have enough pink about you. Figure out for yourself what I mean by pink!
I wanted to make sure Bede was doing a proper job as a Gym Leader, so I decided to join. Though to be honest, things are rather boring since I retired, so this is the perfect distraction.
I’ve got nothing to say. I’m here to win.
I’ve been crushed! I pride myself on my solid Pokémon, and yet this...
Sorry to lose my cool... I’ll be sure to challenge you again.
So what are your top 10 favorite Pokémon? ...That’s just how I break the ice. Are you ready for a Pokémon battle now?
I think you took breaking the ice a little too literally...
It helps inspire my Gym Trainers if I participate in this tournament from time to time! My only choice is to keep aiming for that grand victory!
I’ll get the audience pumped up, even without usin’ Dynamax!
That’s it?! Piers doesn’t do encores, but I admit I’m tempted right now!
Battlin’ you makes me wanna try out a new battle style. Maybe a Pokémon battle and a gig combined. What do you think, huh? Could sound battles be a thing?
I’m going to defeat the Champion, win the whole tournament, and prove to the world just how strong the great Raihan really is!
I look this good even when I lose. It’s a real curse. Guess it’s time for another selfie!
Considering how many likes the photos of my defeats to you get, I bet a victory photo would just explode! Wait... Have I got my priorities mixed up?
If I want people to properly respect me as the new Spikemuth Gym Leader, I need to show just how amazin’ I am by defeatin’ you!
I mean, if you’re gonna win, you could at least win in a way that makes me look good, right?
I’ve been losin’ to you since the Gym Challenge, and I’m gettin’ a bit fed up! You’d better battle me again!
I didn’t do as well in the Gym Challenge as I’d hoped, but...this tournament is different! You’ll see!
That was not what I wanted! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! NO!
I’m going to keep participating in this tournament until I’m satisfied! So you should keep coming, too, Champion!
I’m going to prove beyond doubt that Bug-type Pokémon are strong and competitive!
Losing really bugs me!
I mean, there are different ways to be strong, right? I try not to let losing bring me down. People say I’ve got a tough spirit!
I’m going to soar to the highest point, just like the Pokémon gracefully flying across the sky!
Oh no... Knocked down to the ground...
I’ll be flying again in no time! Once I find a good air current...
My sponsor is here watching me today! I can’t have a pathetic battle!
Of all the days to lose, I lose today...
I get in trouble if I lose too much. They say it damages the company’s brand.
Seeing you plow through the Gym Challenge was a real inspiration for me... But today, I came to win!
I think it’s always important to think about what you can learn from your losses.
Thank you, Champion! I’ll use this experience to review how I battle and reevaluate my strategies.
I traveled all the way to the Kanto region to train my karate! Behold the graceful moves of the Fighting Dojo!
My refined moves had no effect... You’re just too amazing!
I’ve been told to start over every time I am defeated, but to be honest I just wanted to be with my Pokémon.
People think I’m edgy just because I love Poison-type Pokémon!
Losing doesn’t bother me, but I’m bummed that I couldn’t cover you in venom! Blaaah!
Poison can actually become medicine if it’s used properly. Nothing edgy about it!
I prefer these tournaments over the Battle Tower. It’s nice to have an audience!
Oh man, everyone just saw me get crushed... How embarrassing!
I need to redeem myself! I’m gonna retrain my whole team and make myself famous as a Ghost-type user!
Even ice cannot be broken once it becomes a glacier!
The strength I just showed you was only the tip of the iceberg!
I know, I know... If I can’t show it during matches, I can’t claim to have hidden strength.
I am grateful for this chance to defeat the Champion, even though the Gym Challenge is over!
Your Pokémon are so strong, it’s like I’m battling the very land of the Galar region!
Now I know why I couldn’t beat you during the Gym Challenge... But I promise someday I will become strong—as strong as the lands of Galar!
I’ll let the growth of plants overwhelm you!
Oh... I was overwhelmed.
Milo’s as stubborn as weeds, but... I still have a long way to go...
The Trainers of the Galar region need to give the audience a good show. That means we need to show our strength!
Ele-shock! ...Huh? Oh, that means I’m shocked as an Electric-type user.
Even when I’m defeated, I try to give the match my all and shock the audience in a good way!
I use powerful Dragon-type Pokémon. If I’m not strong, then who is?
I couldn’t bring out the true strength of my Dragon-type Pokémon...
I suppose a Trainer must be able to bring out the true potential of their Pokémon!
I’ve built my reputation by building up one win at a time. Think you can bring me down?
It only takes one defeat for everything I’ve built to come crashing down...
My pride was hard as steel too, but you really punched a hole through that.
So, I have a chance to battle the Champion? This tournament’s a great deal!
Well, there goes the burning flame of my ambition...
I guess all I got out of the tournament was a lesson on how strong the Champion is...
Heh heh heh! I hope that battle was a delicate, sweet taste for you!
Don’t suddenly talk to me like that! I accidentally turned around!
And I even switched up my Pokémon while I was running...
Hiding didn’t work, and battles didn’t work... Only thing to do now is run!
It’s frustratin’ that we weren’t able to go toe-to-toe with a Dynamax Pokémon for longer...
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the Gym Challenge! You’re the great Champion, after all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted... You’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym Challengers aiming for your title. I can’t wait to see what talent grows!
My voice is unsure when I’m sad... I wanna yell, but I’m unsure...
Me an’ my team gave it our best. Let’s meet up for a battle again some time...
We’ve created an extraordinary lift that’s safe even for a Pokémon battle.
This building’s well over five hundred feet tall. That’s as tall as around one hundred Machoke standing on top of each other.
You ever get that floaty feeling when a lift is going up?
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!

You two’ve got real coordination. I respect that... Though it doesn’t take the bite out of losin’!
That was some brilliant teamwork! Thanks a lot for the heart-pounding match!
This aching in my knees will be the fuel that sends me surging to new heights of strength!
The pair of us got washed clean away!
My throat’s ragged from shoutin’...but that’s ’cause it was just that excitin’ a battle!
...Y-your coordination was so dazzling, it shone right through my mask.
I fought on to the end and still lost... Well, that’s fine. Long as I fight on to the end next time!
Time to make sure my uniform and head are both on straight and go do some more training.
At least when we fall, we fall like glorious, fluttering rose petals...as celebrities should!

I’ve been losin’ to you since the Gym Challenge, and I’m gettin’ a bit fed up! You’d better battle me again!
It’s time to prove I’m a notch above the competition to everyone in the Galar region. Though I suppose everyone should know by now.
Why did I have the misfortune of being born in the same time period as you...?
If it weren’t for you, then I could prove beyond doubt that I am the best... Still, I do enjoy my battles with you...to a degree.
I didn’t do as well in the Gym Challenge as I’d hoped, but...this tournament is different! You’ll see!
That was not what I wanted! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! NO!
I’m going to keep participating in this tournament until I’m satisfied! So you should keep coming, too, Champion!
I’m going to prove beyond doubt that Bug-type Pokémon are strong and competitive!
Losing really bugs me!
I mean, there are different ways to be strong, right? I try not to let losing bring me down. People say I’ve got a tough spirit!
I’m going to soar to the highest point, just like the Pokémon gracefully flying across the sky!
Oh no... Knocked down to the ground...
I’ll be flying again in no time! Once I find a good air current...
My sponsor is here watching me today! I can’t have a pathetic battle!
Of all the days to lose, I lose today...
I get in trouble if I lose too much. They say it damages the company’s brand.
Seeing you plow through the Gym Challenge was a real inspiration for me... But today, I came to win!
I think it’s always important to think about what you can learn from your losses.
Thank you, Champion! I’ll use this experience to review how I battle and reevaluate my strategies.
I traveled all the way to the Kanto region to train my karate! Behold the graceful moves of the Fighting Dojo!
My refined moves had no effect... You’re just too amazing!
I’ve been told to start over every time I am defeated, but to be honest I just wanted to be with my Pokémon.
People think I’m edgy just because I love Poison-type Pokémon!
Losing doesn’t bother me, but I’m bummed that I couldn’t cover you in venom! Blaaah!
Poison can actually become medicine if it’s used properly. Nothing edgy about it!
I prefer these tournaments over the Battle Tower. It’s nice to have an audience!
Oh man, everyone just saw me get crushed... How embarrassing!
I need to redeem myself! I’m gonna retrain my whole team and make myself famous as a Ghost-type user!
Even ice cannot be broken once it becomes a glacier!
The strength I just showed you was only the tip of the iceberg!
I know, I know... If I can’t show it during matches, I can’t claim to have hidden strength.
I am grateful for this chance to defeat the Champion, even though the Gym Challenge is over!
Your Pokémon are so strong, it’s like I’m battling the very land of the Galar region!
Now I know why I couldn’t beat you during the Gym Challenge... But I promise someday I will become strong—as strong as the lands of Galar!
I’ll let the growth of plants overwhelm you!
Oh... I was overwhelmed.
Milo’s as stubborn as weeds, but... I still have a long way to go...
The Trainers of the Galar region need to give the audience a good show. That means we need to show our strength!
Ele-shock! ...Huh? Oh, that means I’m shocked as an Electric-type user.
Even when I’m defeated, I try to give the match my all and shock the audience in a good way!
I use powerful Dragon-type Pokémon. If I’m not strong, then who is?
I couldn’t bring out the true strength of my Dragon-type Pokémon...
I suppose a Trainer must be able to bring out the true potential of their Pokémon!
I’ve built my reputation by building up one win at a time. Think you can bring me down?
It only takes one defeat for everything I’ve built to come crashing down...
My pride was hard as steel too, but you really punched a hole through that.
So, I have a chance to battle the Champion? This tournament’s a great deal!
Well, there goes the burning flame of my ambition...
I guess all I got out of the tournament was a lesson on how strong the Champion is...
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the Gym Challenge! You’re the great Champion, after all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted... You’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym Challengers aiming for your title. I can’t wait to see what talent grows!
Such strength! I’m in Psyshock!
Oh, my next Pokémon’s gonna make short work of— Huh? That was my last one?
That was everything I hoped for and more!
What a Psystrike to my poor pride...
Just what have you got that I don’t?
Oh, I could just Imprison myself for this!
But I didn’t hold back! I gave it everything I’ve got...
I have been swallowed whole by your great strength!
I did not get the chance to adapt!
Each one of your raindrops hit like a Hydro Pump!
Your strength does not yield to cold or heat!
Light and dark aside, you have certainly broadened my perspective!
Yes, even my strength perfected in light can be overshadowed at times!
Now the darkness surrounds me... I am about to blackout!
It seems you have found your path and sailed right on course!
You young folk grow so fast! It never ceases to amaze me.
You young folk grow so fast! It never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah I lost, but I’m gonna learn from your battle style and everythin’!
Strength ebbs and flows in an endless cycle. One moment you grasp it, and the next, it slips from your hand. But the strength you now have—the strength that let you defeat me—it is unwavering! Congratulations, from the bottom of my heart!
Strength ebbs and flows in an endless cycle. One moment you grasp it, and the next, it slips from your hand. But the strength you now have—the strength that let you defeat me—it is unwavering! Congratulations, from the bottom of my heart!
Gone and got stronger again, have you? Ah well! Hats off to you—in more ways than one!

Looks like I’m down to one last Pokémon. I’ve been saving the best for last!
Flood the stadium and make it our ocean! Drednaw, time to Dynamax!
This is a little gift from us... I hope you can take it!
Woohoo! We’re not going to be done in that easy! We’re tough as weeds!
Come on, then! It’s Dynamax time! You’re about to be uprooted!
This’ll really leave you in shock and awe. It’s our Dynamax move!
A Pokémon battle it is, then! I’ve got two partners with me!
Backed into a corner? You got it all wrong, mate! This’ll just make my victory all the better!
Did you already know about type advantages?!
A critical hit?! What kind of beginner’s luck is that!
It’s not over yet! I’ve added another trusty ally to my team!
Have you gotten a bit stronger? Me and my team will put you to the test and see!
It’ll be a close one! But that’s exactly my sort of match!
Well, look at you! Seems you’ve really learned your type matchups!
You landed a critical hit on my Pokémon?! You’ve got plenty of spirit—that’s for sure!
Wha—? I made such a careless mistake? I’m supposed to be the greatest Trainer ever!
Have a taste of our true power! Our flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power! This wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power! Our green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Keep up, mate! This is our chance to see if we are up to the Gym Challenge!
Landing a critical hit like that... You’re pretty tough when you get serious!
Have a taste of our true power! Our flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power! This wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power! Our green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Typical! Should’ve known you’d mastered type matchups!
Wha—? I made such a careless mistake? I’m supposed to be the greatest Trainer ever!
Let’s have a taste of what a Gym Badge holder’s team can do!
Have a taste of our true power! Our flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power! This wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power! Our green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Every one of my Pokémon is an ace! This is no problem at all!
Typical! Should’ve known you’d mastered type matchups!
Landing a critical hit like that... You’re pretty tough when you get serious!
I’ve learned loads from studying Lee’s battles!
Light that fire and get your mind moving, Kabu! There still must be a path to victory!
Burn bright, Centiskorch. Let Gigantamax change your size and your form!
Flames always burn upwards, and so we’ll always aim to go higher. You understand, don’t you?
I’m counting on you, partner!
[~ 38]
[~ 39]
[~ 40]
Think you’ve got me cornered? Not even close! It’ll be the greatest when I steal this win back!
Now that’s a proper move!
Steady on, partner! I feel your pain, and we’ll get them back for it!
[~ 44]
We’ve faced too much to quit now! We’ve got no choice but to win!
We’ll show you a truly great pink. It’s time for my dear Hatterene to Gigantamax!
Tsk! What’s with that calm expression... Think you’re going to win?
I’ve got everyone’s cheers backin’ me! I’m really, really gonna win this time, got it?
My bro might not use it... But I’ll Gigantamax my Pokémon if it’s to win!
I worked real hard trainin’ my favorite move, just so I could use it in a battle against you!
I’ve gotta win this if I’m gonna be the Champion! I’m comin’ at ya with everythin’ I’ve got!
All I’m after is victory, and I’m counting on you to help me grab it!
Have a taste of our true power! Our flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power! This wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power! Our green power just keeps on growing stronger!
I don’t know what I can do to try to win now... but all I can do is try! There’s nothing else for it!
Who wouldn’t aim for a supereffective hit if they had the chance, right?
Ouch! Even I hurt when you manage to land a critical hit like that one!
How’s that? Supereffective damage! I’m always looking for an opening!
It’s time to dig in our heels! I’m not giving up, so neither should you!
Argh! Fine then, let’s just destroy everything! Your skill is worthy of respect—and Gigantamaxing!
G-Max Chi Strike! I’ll use karate along with my Pokémon’s move!
My very last Pokémon... How lonely... How frightening...
Gengar... Gigantamax... Swallow everything in darkness...
G-Max Terror... It’s like Shadow Tag... You won’t get away... I won’t let you!
Hmph. I’ve already seen more than enough to judge you and your team’s abilities.
I have to win this for the chairman! Do you really think I’d let you keep me from everything I want?
My partner’s move is simply splendid, wouldn’t you say?
You... Do you know my nickname?
The magic-user
The wizard
Bzzzt! Too bad.
Ding ding ding! Congratulations, you’re correct.
What is my favorite color?
Pink
Purple
That’s what I like to see in other people, but it’s not what I like for myself.
Yes, a nice, deep purple... Truly grand, don’t you think?
All righty then... How old am I?
16 years old
88 years old
Hah! I like your answer!
Well, you’re not wrong. But you could’ve been a little more sensitive.
My morning tea is finally kicking in, and not a moment too soon!
Are you prepared? I’m going to have some fun with this.
You lack pink! Here, let us give you some.
All right! Time for me to test exactly how far I can go with my latest and greatest team!
Have a taste of our true power! Our flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power! This wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power! Our green power just keeps on growing stronger!
I’m the kind of guy who gets fired up to win in these situations!
The way you battle... You know, it kind of reminds me of Lee!
Considered the possibility your opponent might land a critical hit on your Pokémon, mate?
How’d you like that attack?! Now I really feel like we’re getting somewhere!
Not yet! I’m not crumbling to dust just yet. We can still battle!
Like a giant mountain boulder! Hiyah! Gigantamax!
Size means strength! Savor this pain!
Even if it cracks, ice is still ice! I’ll show you what I mean!
Come now—go on and Gigantamax. I’ll let you freeze everything solid.
My partner’s signature move invites you to a subzero world!
I’ve powered up a whole lot! I’m gonna beat you lot into the ground, got it?
As expected of my rival! You really know how to get me riled up!
Here’s a special move that I’ve been savin’ for just such an occasion!
Spikemuth initiation! Beatin’ down the challenger!
Everyone, cheer on my Pokémon! Let’s do it, Scrafty! Intimidate the opponent!
Malamar’s gonna mess you all up with its Contrary Ability!
Everyone’s gonna stink, but who cares! Go, Skuntank! Use your Sucker Punch and Toxic!
Time to meet another member of my crew! Face the proud, high roar of my Obstagoon!
I don’t do encores, get it? Not songs... Not moves... Not Pokémon!
Here’s a number I had saved just for this! You lot in the stands better cheer me on!
[~ 111]
It might be impossible to pull off a combo going solo, but it’s not impossible for me to still win!
Bring the storm! My partner will send everyone in the stadium flying!
Let’s do it... Time for our G-Max Depletion! The dragon’s roar will cut right through you!
Let the winds blow! Stream forward, Sandstorm!
The winds rise again! Stream forward, Sandstorm!
Ho? Not bad—changing the weather to Hail like that!
Pulling out a Sunny Day! Hah! That’s not a bad countermeasure!
I’ll feel awful if I lose... But there’s no way I’m gonna!
It’d be no fun if things ended just yet... That’s why we aren’t givin’ up!
Hmm, I think this move expresses my feelin’s. What do you think?
We battled back in the garden, but I’m really really fired up for this match in the stadium!
Think you got me backed into a corner? No way! This’ll just make my victory all the better!
Release all the thoughts poured into my Wishing Star... Time for a Dynamax!
Have a taste of our true power! A burning crimson! Max Flare!
Have a taste of our true power! An overflowing azure! Max Geyser!
Have a taste of our true power! A verdant emerald! Max Overgrowth!
I knew you’d be aiming for a supereffective hit!
How’s that? I learned a lot by studying Lee’s old matches!
All right, a crit! Now we’re really getting up to our full speed!
Steady on! Sure you’re not getting nervous with all the people watching?
My, how cheeky. To do such a thing as to hurt my partner!
This is my last Pokémon? Seriously?! Oleana’s gotta finish this!
Here is a move I was good with even before I changed my image.
I think I’ll treat you to something truly spectacular. A Gigantamax at Rose Tower.
I’m just giving your Pokémon a little chance to shine. That’s all.
Oh dear, what have I been doing? Well, whatever. Let’s just get this over with.
This is a good time to test out a move I’ve been interested in lately.
I learned this move from that old gran! I plan on making it my own!
It’s time to dig in our heels! I’m not giving up, so neither should you!
Argh! Fine then, let’s just destroy everything! It’s time for an honorable Gigantamax!
G-Max Chi Strike! I’ll use karate along with my Pokémon’s move!
You might have one win on me, but this is where I show you what I can really do when I’m serious!
My very last Pokémon... How lonely... How frightening...
Gengar... Gigantamax... Swallow everything in darkness...
G-Max Terror... It’s like Shadow Tag... You won’t get away... I won’t let you!
Everyone’s looking... I want to hide...but I’ll fight!
Looks like I’m down to one last Pokémon. I’ve been saving the best for last!
Flood the stadium and make it our ocean! Drednaw, time to Gigantamax!
This is a little gift from us... I hope you can take it!
Sonia might be disappointed, but I’m going to wash your team away!
That’s Drought! It gets the sunlight burning real harsh!
Bring the storm! My partner will send everyone in the stadium flying!
You do realize I’m the great Raihan, right? I’ll be the one to beat Leon. So first I’ll beat you!
Let’s do it... The dragon roars! Time for my ultimate attack—G-Max Depletion!
Let the winds blow! Stream forward, Sandstorm!
Here comes the rain! Feel its cold dampness soak into your body!
Ho? Not bad—changing the weather to Hail like that!
Here you go! Have a taste of Sunny Day! Have you got a plan to counter it?
[~ 160]
[~ 161]
You’re pretty tough... Yes, entirely too tough. Don’t you think that’s unfair?
Oh, oh? Down to my last Pokémon... Hmm, this isn’t looking too good...
All right, then... Hopefully, this move will turn things around for me.
I’ll show you a move that’ll hit so hard, you’ll be speechless!
It’s one of the duties of the Champion to get the crowd fired up!
It’s a champion time to turn up the heat! Charizard, time for our G-Max Wildfire!
I’m not finished having a champion time here! And I won’t let anyone else finish it for me!
A supereffective hit... I’d expect nothing less from your team!
Aiming for supereffective hits is a surefire way to claim victory!
A critical hit... Hah! Pretty good, Challenger!
Don’t get caught up on a critical hit. Focus on what you’re going to do next!
I’ll show you what Charizard can really do! It’s Gigantamax time!
Hey, looks like we can use our moves now! Thanks to Zacian and Zamazenta, that is!
This is it! Hurry, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Try to catch Eternatus NOW!

Wha—?! The move had no effect on it?!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I can’t see anything! You OK?!
I can’t see anything!
Uwaaaaaah!
The mysterious Pokémon’s gaze is fixed on you...
The mysterious Pokémon’s gaze is fixed on you...
This is the way a real Champion catches Pokémon!
Out you go, Rookidee!
You encountered a wild Wooloo!
Gotcha! Wooloo was caught!
Wow... It’s huge! Let’s take it on together, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
What? I can’t use any moves!
I forgot! We found the sword and shield in the Slumbering Weald!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], use that sword! It might be old and rusted, but there’s got to be some use to it!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], use that shield! It might be old and rusted, but there’s got to be some use to it!
I got it!
Leave it to me!
Hmph! That’s enough faffing about. I suppose it’s time to get serious.
Tch. No more warm ups. It’s time to beat you hollow!
I understand you want to get it over with and lose, but why don’t we enjoy this a little longer!
I know you’re in a hurry to lose, but we should enjoy this for a while longer!
Let’s do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Don’t hold anything back!
My goal was always to surpass Lee, but he’s not the Champion anymore.
I’m not sure what my goal is now.
[~ 240]
[~ 241]
You and Sonia followed your own paths...
I was the only one left behind and trying to catch up!
[~ 244]
But then I went around saving Pokémon alongside you and Piers...
And I realized that I could help other people!
[~ 247]
[~ 248]
Blast! You really got me with that one. But battling you sure is fun, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
[~ 250]
I want to see which of us comes out the victor, and yet I also don’t ever want this battle to end...
That’s the kind of strange feeling I’m having! You feel it, too, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
[~ 253]
[~ 254]
[~ 255]
Yeah!
Not really...
I knew you must! It’s kind of embarrassing, but I’m glad it’s not just me!
What? It’s embarrassing if I’m the only one who’s so into this!
Right then! Laugh or cry all you want, but this is it! This is the end!
[~ 261]
My days as a Gym Leader have made me stronger than you.
You just might be the strongest Champion in Galarian history.
That’s right!
I’ve still got a ways to go!
I’ll carve my name into Galar’s history, too. By defeating you!
I’ll make sure to draw out every last bit of strength from you...and then triumph!
Hmph. Looks like you’ve grown a bit. Only a little bit, though!
Excellent! Not everyone can corner my team like this!
It’s not every day I get to battle you, so I suppose I may as well try out this move.
My cheers will really get you goin’!
Thanks!
Thanks for the help!
Feel that flow! Yeah! You feelin’ it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
Yeah!
Let’s go!
Yeah! Have some of my support! I know you can keep the beat goin’!
You’re the best, Marnie!
Dance, Pokémon!
Zacian has an intense look in its eyes.
Zamazenta has an intense look in its eyes.
Remember, it’s just a test—so take it easy! I’ll be nice and gentle...as I knock you out flat!
How am I the one getting backed into a corner? This should NOT be a thing!
Hah! That’s right! Let my poison drive you Kla-razy!
Oopsie! Guess my move was super effective. Get ready, ’cause there’s more where that came from!
Look, the first damage you took on the Isle of Armor! Consider it a little gift from me!
Heh. I’ll show you what true power looks like.
Wh-when did I get beat down to my last Pokémon?! Did you use Hypnosis on me?
Prepare to experience psychic powers that defy human comprehension!
That’s the power of type matchups. Truly, this shall be an elegant battle!
Heh. I’ve dealt the first damage you’ve taken on this island.
Yippee! Oh, I just can’t wait to see you battle your heart out!
Ohoho! Looks like my little old self’s been cornered. I’m getting the shivers!
Oof, super-duper effective! Uh-oh, I smell danger!
Yeeek! When luck favors you like that, it’s a sure sign you’re a good Trainer!
Let’s set the record straight right here. I’ll show you once and for all that I’m the better Trainer!
Am I really gonna lose again? Is there just... something wrong with me?
Go on! Get ’em! Knock ’em flat! And give ’em a little venom for good measure!
Oh fine, hit us with our weakness! What’re you, a supereffective move machine?!
Hmph! Enjoy your dumb luck while it lasts, ’cause it ain’t gonna happen again!
Oooh look at that! My attack worked just great. Now get ready for another dose!
I think it’s about time we found out...which of us is truly superior!
I am not weak! I cannot lose!
I’ll have you dancing in the palm of my hand! This is my most powerful, elegant Psychic move!
H-how cheeky. Let’s agree that move is banned from now on, yes?
The fates have truly abandoned me. I am but a poor little lost Wooloo.
Before my psychic powers, all your weaknesses are laid bare!
I’m not holding a single thing back anymore. Time to settle this—fair and square!
Oh, and maybe watch your step... Looks like some [VAR FF00(0006)]Toxic Spikes[VAR FF00(0000)] somehow got on the Battle Court!
There’s no way I’m losing! I ain’t letting go till the bitter end!
Watch out, audience! One dose of Klara poison and there’s no turning back!
They say the dose makes the poison, so have seconds! Here’s a full-course feast of venom!
Sorry, my dear Pokémon! I should’ve given better directions. But hang in there! You’ve got this!
Hmph! Well, look who’s just a type-matchup master. Ain’t that nice for you!
Ah-HA! That’s right! Let my poison drive you Kla-razy!
Heh. Let us have an elegant battle worthy of being called a finale.
Prepare to sink into despair...and into the [VAR FF00(0006)]weird battlefield[VAR FF00(0000)] beneath your feet!
We shall awaken our true psychic power here and now!
With a one, two, three...this Poké Ball will grow gigantic!
My unbelievable psychic powers will utterly humiliate you!
Ah! Are you all right, my elegant Pokémon?
The move had no effect?! Such an injustice. I’m so steamed, my glasses are fogging up!
Heh, a supereffective hit! That was an elegant move choice on my part, wouldn’t you agree?
I’ll need to get serious if I am to take you on!
Hone your senses now...and let this battle sharpen you! Show me how you can grow!
Watch closely, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This is what Kubfu’s fists are truly capable of!
Oho! Stings to let a critical hit slip on through, doesn’t it?
It’s been a while since I faced such a strong opponent... My blood’s boiling over!
Time to see exactly what all this training has made of you!
My skills are only getting sharper! Try not to get captivated by my might!
Now, become the gigantic fist that breaks your opponent—as one would smash through a board!
Let’s see if you can withstand this move! Show me what you’re made of!
Aha! I see you’ve got your fundamentals down pat. But that alone won’t cut it!
Brought luck over to your side, have you? That makes you all the more enticing an opponent!
Let that be a reminder—a single slip could cost you everything!
Fuhaha! Seems like victory smiles on me today!
All right now, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s have some fun...and I’ll try not to hurt you!
Ahh, the tension that comes when it’s down to the wire! This is where it gets fun!
Time to play our ace in the hole! Turn gigantic, my dear Venusaur!
You’d better brace yourself for this... Think of it as a little tough love!
Time to play our ace in the hole! Turn gigantic, my dear Blastoise!
Try not to get washed away in this deluge, all right, love?
Gahaha! Aren’t you the brave one, pickin’ a fight with a onetime Gym Leader!
Steel’s tough as they come! The more hits it takes, the more ultra-mega-determined it gets!
Time for the tough to get goin’! Let loose, Aggron!
Not bad! Not bad at all! But watch out—next time, it’s my turn!
Brrriiice!
Glastrier is after your Iceroot Carrot!
Sheighhhhd!
Spectrier is after your Shaderoot Carrot!
Cro rown!
Ro crow own!
It seems this calls for my true psychic powers. I daresay victory will change hands this time!
Behold my psychic power’s maddening potency... I’m afraid this move will put you in checkmate!
I command you to grow enormous, my elegant Pokémon!
This battle ain’t over yet! My heart’s unbreakable, you hear?!
They say one person’s poison is another person’s tonic... But Klara’s poison is super potent!
Keep your eyes peeled, everyone! It’s time for Klara’s big moment!
The toughest opponents only make us stronger! Time to turn this battle around!
I won’t go easy on you, so do your best to survive! Brace yourself!
Let your colossal fists shatter any wall that stands in your way!
For steel, toughness is everythin’! A little pressure won’t make me lose heart!
Get ready for an ultra-mega-impact! Here comes a massive one!
Feels like time for a dose of you-know-what! Get ready to see some REAL bulk!
You lot are so strong, I’ve got to doff my cap... But this isn’t over yet!
Let’s see how hot your passion burns! Go, Charizard! G-Max Wildfire!
Get ready—here comes the climax! It’s Gigantamax time!
*sigh*... You think you can win, don’t you? I suppose I should correct such wishful thinking!
If you think you can avoid this, go ahead and try! Crush them with G-Max Smite!
Let’s blot them out with our color, Hatterene! Time to Gigantamax!
I ain’t goin’ down that easy! I got skin in this game too, y’know!
I’m real proud of how well I’ve honed this move! Get ready to get sent packin’!
All right, Grimmsnarl! Make my wishes come true...and Gigantamax!
Time to dig my heels in for my friends! Just need to grow until we can reach victory!
My moves are grown with care in my garden! Don’t let yourselves get knocked flat!
Grow big and strong—Gigantamax! Time to harvest victory!
Even my last drop is enough to submerge you!
How long do you think you can stay dry up against our tidal might?
Get ready to be marooned in the widest of seas! Drednaw—time to Gigantamax!
Come on, Kabu—you can still win! Burn a path through to victory!
The only place I’m going is to the top! I’ll blaze my way through each battle!
Let your flames scorch all of Galar! I believe in you, Centiskorch!
I’ve got one last number for ya! Get ready to etch it into your ears and hearts!
Watch me strum out one wicked move! Get ready—I’m turnin’ it up to eleven!
All right, Raihan! Time to win this and become the true Galarian star you were born to be!
Ring out, dragon’s roar! Let them feel it in their bones!
Stand tall, Duraludon! Smash their hopes of winning to pieces!
You’d better concentrate! If you make the smallest slip, I’ll pounce on it!
Put your hips into it when you punch! Then take that fist and seize us our victory!
Time to go on the offensive! We’ll change the course of this battle with one hit!
All it takes is one pitfall to defeat you. How shall I start digging...?
Rise up, G-Max Volcalith! Can you escape from the prison of stone?
You’re unbreakable, Coalossal! I’ve got absolute faith in you!
Good-byes are so sad... P-please...stay with me...
I want to keep my whole team together... I’ll never...let any of them go!
C-creep out of the shadows, Gengar. Show them all your reproach...
The final freeze is the deepest! Get ready to shiver down to your bones!
Now watch how your partner Melony uses her ice, and feel the chill creep in!
Looks like an ice age is looming... How many minutes do you think you’ll last?
M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! How do you like this? I’ve...I’ve nothing left!
Now, let loose a move so dignified it defies description!
Only a true celebrity could retain this great poise in this great peril!
Feel free to gaze in wonderment at this move— as noble as it is damaging!
You’ve got us up against the wall, mate, but you’re about to see what we’re really made of!
See if you can keep up with this beat! Rillaboom, use G-Max Drum Solo!
I’ve got some massive dreams, and the only thing big enough to hold ’em is Gigantamaxing!
Burn ’em up, Cinderace! Show us a G-Max Fireball!
Wash ’em all away, Inteleon! Use G-Max Hydrosnipe!
Well now, that move certainly woke me up. It’d be rude not to return the favor!
There’s more to strength than just physical power. Now, let’s sap some of that vitality!
Keeping things simple is just boring. Have a taste of this refined flavor!

Master! I’ll never give up on the dojo! My psychic power will end things here and now!
Fuhaha! Now that’s what I like to hear. In that case, let’s do this elegantly!
Behold our elegance...even when one of us dared turn his back on the Psychic type!
*tsk*... Those floating balls are so distracting. Still, we’re going to win!
Well, if I must share the pitch with a Dark-type Trainer...at least we’re on the same side.
A pair of newly minted Gym Leaders like us can take on anyone—even the Champion!
Hee hee! C’mon, Bede! Let’s poison them, nice and proper!
You’re a little disquieting, you know... Just try not to get in my way.
All eyes on me, Master! I’ll show you that I’m cute AND strong!
This should be fun! But I don’t plan on letting you steal the spotlight for strength or adorableness!
Team Supercute with Klara and Marnie! Everyone’s gonna be head over heels for us!
I-I’unno about cute or anythin’... But sendin’ ’em head over heels works for me!
Take it easy on those brittle bones, old bloke! The Peony train won’t stop for any bellyachin’!
Watch your mouth, youngster! Try not to get knocked out too soon!
Master Mustard! It’s an honor to battle at your side!
Not to copy you, my boy, but with two former Champions...it’ll be a doubly champion time!
Right then, Leon lad! Let’s put ’em down nice and quick!
I’m looking forward to fighting alongside Steel Peony himself!
All right, Kabu! Let’s show ’em what us edgy older blokes are made of!
Not a bad idea! Say, if we win, why don’t you come back to the League?
Now then, my bed-headed partner! Let us comport ourselves as celebrities would!
What?! This isn’t bed head! That nonsense on your head is worse, anyway!
Like there’s any way us two together could lose! Got yer spikes all tuned up?
You bet! C’mon, Bro—let’s show ’em we’re even fiercer together!
Would you like a cheer from my noble self, miss Dark-type Trainer with your boldly cut hair?
L-lay off! I don’t need your cheerin’! Let’s just focus on the battle!
Your water’s got my Pokémon all energized and happy, Nessa!
I’ll extinguish any flame that so much as casts a spark at your greenery!
Water and rock can douse flame, but my Pokémon can absorb them both!
I’m counting on you, Milo! Let’s show everyone what this team can do!
My Grass-type Pokémon have got your back, Piers! We’ll make sure you have center stage!
Aw, quit embarrassin’ me, Milo! You’ll have to Dynamax for the pair of us!
Hello there, Allister! No need to get nervous. Let’s battle at our own pace!
Th-thanks, Milo... I...appreciate it...
We’ll burn away any plants that try to wring you dry, Nessa!
Great! And let us wash away any stone or earth that tries to quench your flames!
I look forward to learning from the ever-shifting nature of your Water-type moves!
In serious mode like always, aren’t you? Let’s go have a nice dessert once we’ve won!
Water helps push rocks forward... The opponent doesn’t stand a chance!
I never get tired of seeing those backward somersaults of yours, Gordie...
Dark and Dragon, scales and shade! ♪ Fairy types get us both afraid! ♪
You just keep on singing, Piers! I’ll dish out all the damage we need!
All right, Raihan! Use those weather tricks and make it rain cheers in this stadium!
Way ahead of you, Leon! Though I’m already looking forward to taking YOU on!
Remember our plan, Raihan! I’m counting on you to get that weather going!
No hard feelings if the plan slips my mind! You know I run wild in battle!
Hello there, Raihan! I look forward to battling alongside such a mighty Gym Leader!
I know I’m in for a rough time with you, Melony! You’re tough on teammates and opponents alike!
Let’s use our rock-solid moves to crush the willpower of any opponent!
That’s an encouraging sentiment. Let’s take the fight to them, Gordie.
Let us put up a fight worthy of showing to M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!
It goes without saying, Older Brother! Such is our noble duty!
[~ 469]
[~ 470]
Don’t mind me, child. You got all the correct answers to my quizzes, so do as you please.
I’ll still back you up the best I can to take some weight off your shoulders, Ms. Opal!
Come now, Bede... Time for our Double Pink Typhoon!
I don’t think that’s a move, Ms. Opal... No matter—I’m sure we’ll win!
What better team-up to make our opponents shiver than Ice and Ghost types?
R-right you are! W-we’ll send chills up their spines...
Come on, Hop! Our bond as brothers is way stronger than any Champion!
I know [VAR 0100(0000)] better than anybody. You just leave h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to me!
Remember our Gym Challenge? I’m gonna let loose all the frustration I’ve been holdin’ in since!
Watch yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your old rivals are teaming up to take you down!
Now, I haven’t battled at your side for quite a long while. It’s almost a little embarrassing!
Fuhahaha! We’re still too young to be reminiscing about the good old days, Opal!
Do your best, young Piers. Or I’ll...Play Rough.
Yeah, I’ve gotta pass on that. I don’t think I could handle havin’ an 88-year-old Play Rough.
What say we give this stadium a nice cooling off, Nessa, dear?
Gladly! Let’s dazzle the whole place with our glimmering teamwork!
I’m truly honored to get to battle alongside such a legendary Champion.
Come now, don’t be shy! Stand tall! Let us enjoy the clashing of fists together!
I-I-I’ll...do my best!
Don’t be so nervous, boy! I’m looking forward to seeing how you battle!
I trust you to bring us a silvery-white victory, Lady Melony!
Oh, you’ll embarrass me with that “Lady” talk. Anyway, I’ll leave the Fighting types to you!
Aaah! Ohmygosh, Gordie! You’re super popular! I can’t believe we’re on the same team!
Um, do be careful. A lot of my fans can get a little wild sometimes...
Battling gifted opponents gets my heart beating, no matter how many times I do it!
Let’s hurry and get this started! Time to see who can win some Exp. Points off the other!
I’m really up against the wall now...which will make winning all the more satisfying!
Flex your gigantic muscles, Urshifu! Let your mighty frame burst through the sky itself!
Every one of the thousands of times we’ve swung our fists was for the sake of this moment!
Hmm, yes! I feel an unyielding power emanating from that Pokémon and that move!
Now, was that pinpoint aim or plain luck? Either way...it made things interesting!
A little lapse in judgment, eh? How unlike you!
A fine stroke of luck...but I know you won’t be worn out as easily as that!
I’m still working on getting stronger! So don’t go laughing if I don’t do well!
Still not pulling any punches, I see. Not that I care or anything!
All righty, Slowbro! Time to dream bigger— and be bigger!
Your Pokémon will look sooo much cuter once I give it a nice coat of venom!
You’ll have to do more than that to make me lose heart! I’m gettin’ better every day!
Gah! Seriously? It didn’t work? I hate this...but I should’ve expected as much.
Tee hee! That’s me—as cute as I am clever with moves!
I’ll send your head spinning just like this Poké Ball!
My power only grows when my back’s to the wall. You’ve no one to blame for this but yourself!
With a one, two, three...my Pokémon will be gigantic! And with nothing up my sleeves, either!
Witness my ESP! Which, of course, stands for Elegant Spectacular Power!
S-super effective? Your Nature certainly isn’t Calm, is it?
M-my glasses were foggy! That’s it! I couldn’t see anything—that’s why that happened!
No amount of training can hide one’s weaknesses... That goes for you, too!
All right, let’s give it a go! Watch out, I’m going to get serious!
You’re doing just splendidly, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This is exactly what makes you our rising star!
All right, my dear Venusaur! Bloom so fully your petals cover the whole island!
Sorry if this stings a bit. That’s just how tough love works!
All right, my dear Blastoise, get ready to give a soaking! Show us that big, splendid shell!
Sorry if you get a bit soggy. I’ll lend you a towel when we’re through here!
My dear Nia’s watchin’ from the sidelines! Time to activate coolest-dad-ever mode!

Doesn’t matter if we win or lose... Let’s just have fun!
I might be young, but I hope you won’t hold that against me.
I’m not like all the rest of those youngsters you might’ve battled till now!
Deep breath in, and...deep breath out... No, wait—I’m still not ready for this!
I’m gonna do this! I’m gonna take you on! I’m gonna hold nothing back!
Well, look at you... I think I could go all out if it were against you.
Watch as I show you what my studies have taught me!
I’m the president of my school’s Pokémon club!
If I keep making my opponent’s Pokémon flinch, then it’s like my turn never ever ends!
Crumbs, y-you look strong... I’m not sure I’m up for this...
Oh my word, it’s been AGES since I last saw you! How’ve you been doing?!
Let’s battle to decide which one of us has the cutest Pokémon!
Pika pika?
I can relax the best when I’m dressed up like a Pikachu.
Guess what! Guess what! Folks are always telling me my team’s real strong!
I’m going to use my Veevee power to make you cry wee, wee, wee all the way home!
I was out playing, and I ended up wandering in here by mistake!
I’m here in my jam jams! Guess I’ll battle in jam jams!
I don’t go easy on anyone. Not even on children.
I’ve just popped over for a battle during my break time, so let’s make this quick!
Here, let me give you my card... What, you don’t have a business card?
I take all the stress I’ve built up in my workplace and blast it all away with a good battle!
Time to leverage my core competencies! I’ve got buy-in from all my Pokémon!
I wish I could get paid just for battling Pokémon...
You’re the Champion, aren’t you?! C-could I get your autograph?
My shorts are from Jetsetter. It’s a famous brand, I’ll have you know.
Show my Pokémon a bit of love, won’t you?
Ah... That’s it! I’ve decided! If I win this match, I’m going to tell my crush exactly how I feel!
Statistically speaking, the odds are 95 percent certain that I’ll win!
Do your best in this battle! ’Cause I’m live streaming it all, see!
... ... ... You gonna start this or what?
If I’m good at Pokémon battles, I’ll be popular!
It’s not just a costume! I really am a Pokémon!
Nice to meetcha, pika! Want a battle, pika pika?
Pokémon with Hidden Abilities are hard to find in the wild, but guess who got lucky?
Your Pokémon shall be my Pokémon’s playthings!
If I had to rank my strength, I’d say it’s... at the lower end of average.
I don’t get enough exercise in my daily life, so I’m here to do some Pokémon battling!
Let’s make this a real flashy battle worth posting on all my feeds, OK?
Want to know what kind of work I do around the office?
Pokémon Breeders have to be early risers!
Pokémon that are hatched from Eggs may know unusual moves!
It’s love that makes me raise them... And love that makes me battle with them.
All right there? I’m a new Breeder! Charmed, I’m sure!
Safety first! Then Poké Ball second!
Have you been enjoying riding on the trains that I bust my butt to maintain?!
When it comes to battle, my Pokémon have got the heart to take part! Have you?!
I’ve got a doctor’s note. I can’t be expected to lift anything heavier than a Poké Ball...
You...you smell strong to me. Or at least like you haven’t showered in a while.
I’ve been training myself up through an online karate class! Hiyah!
I’ve been living alone up in the mountains and training my Pokémon without distraction!
You can see it, can’t you? How positively cut my six-pack is?
Huh? What’s going on? Are we supposed to battle now or something?
The people in Galar are all so nice! Are you?
I’m off duty today, mate. I’ll not be hearing any of that “the customer is always right” rubbish!
Where to, guv?
The true heart of fishing is being able to wait! And wait...and wait...and wait...
Fancy a spot of fishing? I love me a good bit of fishing.
Hrmmm?! You look right suspicious to me! I think I’ll have to take you in for questioning!
I’m not skiving off work—I swear it! This tower is a part of my regular patrol beat!
I’m the living proof that there’s no reason you can’t be both beautiful and strong! Watch this!
I’m a star on and off the runway. Now see how I shine.
How about a double shot... of defeat?!
I bring richness and depth to everything I do, whether its brewing a drink or battling Pokémon!
I come from one of the great noble houses of the Galar region.
I am here to evaluate the quality of your team, both in terms of strength and appearance.
My Pokémon are as strong as anything! We’re gonna show you, you young thing!
All right! I’m up for a battle with you! Let’s get this place...ROCKING!
The Pokémon are the lead performers! I’m just a backup dancer!
Let’s dance!
It’s pretty tough going once you reach this level. Not many make it higher than this.
No WAY! You’re the Champion! Get out!! This is, like, the greatest day of my life!
I’m here taking part in the Battle Tower together with my girlfriend!
I’m here taking part in the Battle Tower together with my boyfriend!
I might look like a Pokémon, but don’t you dare hit me with any of your moves!
Kneel down before me!
They said I had to come battle here as part of my new-hire orientation, that’s all...
I AM A ROBOT IN HUMAN APPEARANCE. I WILL DEEPEN MY TIES WITH POKÉMON.
Are you raising your Pokémon? Or are you not?
My babies are all frightfully cute!
Feast your eyes on the muscles I’ve developed doing years of hard construction labor!
All right, pack it in! Let’s get this battle over and done with!
I joined up as part of the League staff because I heard I’d be popular that way!
People say I seem harsh, but I’m really very nice!
Let’s begin the operation... Scalpel, please.
What’s this? You’d like me to examine your Pokémon?
Battle is like art in so many ways! But art is completely different than battle!
Hehe! Well, aren’t you a cute little thing I get to take on in battle! ♪
I shall show you how a true gentleman battles.
Well, have a look at you! You are the spitting image of my grandchildren, dear.
Student and Trainer! I’ve got many hats to wear, all right?!
I never fit in with the others at school. This is the only place I really belong!
No one in my class offers me any challenge. I wonder if you’ll be any different?
Don’t you dare think I’ll be an easy pushover just because I’m still a child!
I’m gonna come at you like whoa, then bam, and you’re gonna totally be like “whaaat!”
Battling and winning... Tell me—what does it all mean?
When I grow up, my dream is to be Champion!
I’ve waited 20 years for this day to come!
It’s important you don’t neglect all the routine tasks, whether it’s for work or training Pokémon.
I got off at the wrong stop on the monorail and somehow ended up at the Battle Tower.
Eek! Y-you weren’t watching me just now, right?!
I won’t raise any Pokémon that don’t have adorable backsides to watch in battle!
Hm? I think I’ve seen you at the station.
Mind the gap between yourself and victory. Mind the gap.
It’s mighty strange, but for some reason, folk oft seem to feel poorly after eating my cooking.
Pokémon that have been carefully seasoned with the perfect amount of training... Masterful!
I’m a wandering day laborer. I go where my heart leads, then dig, dig, dig till I can’t dig no more.
Hope you’re ready for some hard hits! The right moves take weight into consideration!
I’d meant to become a flower arranger, but I ended up as a boilermaker!
My helmet’s as durable as my Pokémon!
I’m going to hit your Pokémon right where it hurts! This’ll be a critical battle!
I’m sleepy... This is such a pain... I didn’t sleep but two hours last night!
When you do this job long enough, you develop a knack for telling who’s strong at a glance.
Truth is, I’d rather just be at home, relaxing and vegging out with my Pokémon...
“A Serious Battle”—scene one, take one! Three, two, one, and...action!
I’m gonna film you so up close and personal, your pores are gonna be famous!
Hah...hah... I...I battled all the way here just to get an exclusive interview with you!
I’m live on the scene here at the Battle Tower! What a sight! You getting this back in the studio?
I’ve heard that Pokémon battling can be a pretty good workout.
Join the legions of my fans!
They call me the connoisseur of moves!
I often see you coming round to the Pokémon Center for a bit of care.
Here I am out on my journey, and I meet you!
Don’t blow my cover! I’m part of the International Police, here on a lead about a certain case!
You’re coming to my gig tonight, right? You’ll buy tickets, right?
People always seemed shocked to find out I’m an opera singer. Guess it must be my face...
There’s one thing you really need for battle... A killer sense of rhythm!
It’s been three years since I left home to become a star! I’m not going back till I’ve made it!
You look like a strong one! Ever thought of joining the force?
I was a real bad seed when I was young. Everybody feared me in the neighborhood.
Can we get this over with? I’m due for a yoga class soon!
I nip my competition in the bud before it has the chance to grow. That’s how I’ve made it this far.
B-blimey but I’m nervous... Please be kind!
My shorts are the perfect fit! That means I can’t lose!
I’ve got a test tomorrow that I should be revising for, but I came for a battle instead!
Can you hear me? I’m talking directly to your mind right now.
Postal delivery! I’ve got a parcel here with your name on it. Oh, look. The contents say “defeat.”
I’ll walk all over you with the well-developed calves I got from years of making deliveries!
When I wear a surgical mask, it makes my glasses fog up!
Steady on. You don’t look very well. I think what you need is a jab.
People call me “the angel in the white coat.” Just thought I’d mention it.
RKS Laboratories is like a home to me. I work such long hours, I rarely see my real one...
I’ve got you covered. Just say the place, and I’ll have you there in a heartbeat.
My top priority is your safety and comfort. Which is why I expect you’ll pay extra, eh?
Body temperature and weight are both right on track! These Pokémon are in top condition!
Oh-ho? Now this is a promising specimen! I’d definitely like to see more!
Come on! No grumbling accepted here. Let’s let our Pokémon do the talking!
What would you say your training style is? Generous and openhanded? Or maybe spartan?
I’ve grown so weary of all the world’s pleasures. Now all I do from dawn to dusk is battle wildly.
Why don’t I give you the chance to see the Pokémon I’ve spent a fortune raising!
My children have all grown and left home. Now I’m embarking on a new life of my own!
I heard the other ladies at the club saying that Pokémon were quite the thing, so here I am.
Heh! If you want to know what moves my Pokémon use, you’re about to learn firsthand!
*scritch scritch scritch* Wood carving... *scritch scritch scritch* It’s so zen...
After years and years of training, I’ve finally managed to obtain the ultimate moves!
Wot’s this? You my next victim?
Be a good sport. Let’s have a fair-and-square battle.
Being able to read a Pokémon’s mind... That’s the real trick to fishing.
I’m in the market for a fishing buddy! How about you? Care to go fish with me?
Life’s got its mountains and its valleys. Just like this tower’s got its highs and lows!
I love climbing up to the top, and I love tumbling down to the bottom, too!
I’ve filled myself with the great power of boundless nature!
All right, there? You strong or what? I’m gonna expect a good battle, yeah?
I-if I win, would you help me get a hotel room for tonight? I’m so tired of camping...
The battle’s not over until it’s over. Don’t let your focus slip!
Winning and losing aren’t as important to me as having a right good time!
I battled and battled and battled... All to be standing right here!
Hahaha! Think you can show me a fun time?
I’ve left behind my family, my friends—everything. The only thing for me is this—the battlefield.
Think you can keep up with the spweed at which I ewolve and change?
Our department takes a real hard-line stance. No lenience for juveniles!
My boyfriend broke my heart... Now I’m ready to break yours!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve been waiting for you. Always knew you’d be able to win your way here. Now, how about you take on Challenger Leon with everything that you’ve got?
Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Just as I knew you’d do! I never expected the Poké Ball Tier would hold you long... Now it’s time you and I had some fun!
The Battle Tower is the place to go if you want to see how Trainers dedicated to growing stronger live and do battle. Looks as though your own strength is about as amazing as ever, [VAR 0100(0000)]. But I’ll not just take your word for it!
My dream has always been to make the people of the Galar region stronger. And this Battle Tower is making that dream come true! So come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Think you and I can get even stronger, too? A fierce battle is the only way to do it!
Looking back at when I first met you in Wedgehurst, the path to this place feels... well, short in one way, but so long in others. Allow me to be the one who faces you in the greatest-ever match here at the Battle Tower!
I knew you had it in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I was sure you and your Pokémon would blast right through the first stage of the Battle Tower! But don’t go thinking you’ve seen all the Battle Tower has to offer. We’re only getting started!
Your Pokémon certainly look delighted to battle alongside you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! But of course they do! They’re lucky enough to battle with a Trainer who knows just how to draw out the best of them! That’s it. I’m gonna be sure to draw out even more of my own team members from now on, too!
The strong desire to win! That’s the trigger that makes you accumulate new skills and transform experience into strength! And you and your team—you’ve got a real great desire to win, don’t you! Love it! But you still haven’t seen the real challenge the Battle Tower is waiting to throw at you!
Now, that’s an absolutely champion time! The stronger you get, the more the Trainers here at the Battle Tower burn with the desire to be the one to beat you and break your streak! Their Pokémon are all sharpening their teeth and claws in anticipation! And I’ll be putting together my greatest ever team, too. Naturally! So, do your best to reach me once again!
The greatest battle of the Battle Tower is over... But at least since it was between you and me... No, since it was between your team and mine, we managed to make it one brilliant match! Champion! I hope this isn’t the last time I get to meet you in battle! Keep challenging me! So that I can keep reaching ever greater heights!
[~ 182]
Please select a battle format and the Pokémon you’d like to take part.
Then in you go!
Thank you for coming. This is the Battle Tower!
Can I help you with something?
Would you like to continue battling?
Good work in there! The Battle Tower is ready whenever you are!
Oh, that’s a shame to see... We look forward to your next challenge.
Congratulations! You’ve moved up in the ranks! You’re now Rank [VAR 012E(0000)]!
You’ve earned a reward for moving up through the ranks!
The Judge function has been unlocked! You can now use it in your Boxes!
You can now choose which background music you’d like to listen to in the Battle Tower!
Congratulations on the fine job defeating Leon in the Master Ball Tier! We have a special Ribbon for the Pokémon in your party!
The Battle Tower is quite what it says on the tin. It’s a place where you can have Pokémon battles. You can battle following the same rules as you might in Ranked Battles. If you win, you can earn Rare Candies and BP. You can use Rental Teams, too, so no worries that you need a perfect team of your own to take part!
I want to battle
Tell me about this place
No, thanks
Keep battling
You obtained [VAR 0201(0002)] [VAR 0109(0001)]!
You earned [VAR 0201(0003)] BP!
You got Leon’s rare League Card!
You got a new uniform!
Lend me a team!
Never mind
Lend me this team!
Tell me about this team!
Show me another team!
You want to borrow one of my Battle Teams?
Come talk to me whenever you want to borrow a proper team of Pokémon.
What sort of team would you like to take for a spin?
Ah... Looks like you’ve rented all the teams you can right now.
You’re interested in this Battle Team?
Put ’em through their paces!
You’re already borrowing this team.
Basic Team
Skill Team
Tough Team
Rain Team
Slow Team
Never mind
This team is good for Single Battles! It’s a nice, simple team that’s built around three Pokémon close to the heart of anyone in Galar. Take a good hard look at what types of Pokémon your opponent is sending out, then choose one of these great allies to send out yourself!
This team is good for Single Battles! The Pokémon on this team know tons of moves that can help them boost their stats in battle. Send out Duraludon first and have it use Reflect or Light Screen to get a defensive advantage, then swap in others as fit for the situation!
This team is good for Single Battles! This almighty team is ready for any opponents. Of course they can unleash heavy hit after heavy hit, but if you also use their status moves wisely, then you might even be able to pull out a win against opponents that might usually put you in a real sticky situation!
This rain-ready team is good for Double Battles! Falling rain can boost the power of their moves or trigger certain Abilities, so start by sending out Pelipper first to get the rain going and get this team rolling!
This team is good for Double Battles! They might look real slow to start with, but all you need is a good Trick Room, and suddenly your slow bulky team will be a fast bulky team! Lucario will be great support if you know how to use it, so hurry straight into a Trick Room!
[~ 227]
And that’s not all! You’ve reached the [VAR 012E(0001)]!
[~ 229]
That drops you down a rank, I’m afraid...
I’ll give you one of my League Cards... And not just any old one—this is a rare one!
All right! You should take this. I reckon it’ll fit you as well as it could anyone.
Mr. Al Rent
You rented [VAR 01BF(0000)]!

Benedict
Yaaay! I won! I won! I totally, definitely won!
I’m going home!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
Marko
Oh my... I didn’t expect to win.
Impressive! You’re quite the Trainer!
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
Brent
This is to be expected. I am the king of all youngsters, after all!
Next time I’ll come back with long pants...
[~ 13]
[~ 14]
Ellie
I wasn’t ready, but I won anyway!
I wasn’t ready! I would have won, otherwise!
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Ava
Yay! I won! I gave it all my energy, and it paid off!
Aww, I lost... Still, I won’t let this bring me down! I’ll always give my best!
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
Moira
Huh. I guess I didn’t need to go all out on you.
Hey! I was only battling at 2 percent of my full power, OK?!
[~ 28]
[~ 29]
Finley
I knew my hunch was right!
That does it! I’m studying up on how to get sweet revenge next!
[~ 33]
[~ 34]
Reu
That victory’s for all my mates in the Pokémon club!
I...I don’t deserve to be the president of the Pokémon club...
[~ 38]
[~ 39]
Theodore
I’m so strong, I must have made you flinch!
You didn’t even flinch! What, is your Ability Inner Focus or something?
[~ 43]
[~ 44]
Zara
Wow, I won...? Oh dear, I don’t think I can keep this up...
I knew I couldn’t do it...
[~ 48]
[~ 49]
Dusk
Huh? I didn’t know I was this strong!
Wait—have we even met before...?
[~ 53]
[~ 54]
Holly
Looks like my Pokémon are both stronger and cuter than yours!
I still win at being cute! Even against your Pokémon!
[~ 58]
[~ 59]
Albert
Pika!
Pika...

I’m gonna keep dressing up as a Pikachu, even when I’m all grown-up!
I guess being relaxed doesn’t make me stronger!
[~ 68]
[~ 69]
Robin
See? See?! I knew my Pokémon were strong!
But...but how?! How could I have lost?
[~ 73]
[~ 74]
Alex
Vee!
Ee... Vee...?
[~ 78]
[~ 79]
Dromena
Hee hee hee! I bet you thought I was just a scared, lost child!
I was hoping you’d let your guard down around a lost child...
[~ 83]
[~ 84]
Penelope
Shhh... Just go to sleep.
Nighty-night!
[~ 88]
[~ 89]
Clarence
Hya-haaa! This is the strength of an adult!
That’s not what I’d call “going easy”...
[~ 93]
[~ 94]
Stanley
I just got a message from my boss! I need to get back to the office!
Well, that’s that... My break time sure went quickly...
[~ 98]
[~ 99]
Hugo
Exchanging business cards is basic business etiquette!
Since we’re both Trainers, I guess we could trade League Cards.
[~ 103]
[~ 104]
Sayla
Victory’s always so refreshing! Now, if I could only finish my work as easily...
Great, now I’m stressed out about losing on top of being stressed out about work!
[~ 108]
[~ 109]
Orla
I gave my 110 percent. It’s the optimal strategy to achieve exponential growth!
We’re seeing a downturn in projected results. I need more synergistic interactions on my team.
[~ 113]
[~ 114]
Thea
Maybe it’s not too late for me to become a Gym Leader!
It’s not going to happen if I’m so easily defeated, I guess...
[~ 118]
[~ 119]
Stan
Wow, I beat the Champion! Maybe I can give you my autograph?
Aw, I lost! I don’t want an autograph anymore!
[~ 123]
[~ 124]
Brenner
Wearing brand-name shorts really does make you stronger in battle!
I was too busy worrying about my brand-name shorts! I couldn’t focus!
[~ 128]
[~ 129]
Kushi
Oops! Guess I showed your Pokémon a little too much love!
That’s not what I meant when I said show them a bit of love!
[~ 133]
[~ 134]
Darcie
No, no, wait! I didn’t really mean it!
Whew... I know I lost, but I’m a little relieved.
[~ 138]
[~ 139]
Bon
Just as I calculated!
But you only had a 5 percent chance to defeat me!
[~ 143]
[~ 144]
Albie
That’s going to be a wicked video! Don’t forget to give it a good rating!
M-my followers won’t let you get away with this!
[~ 148]
[~ 149]
Sienna
... ... ... I win.
... ... ... *sniff*
[~ 153]
[~ 154]
Silky
I did it! Now I’ll be popular!
No! I don’t want to be unpopular!
[~ 158]
[~ 159]
Fero
I’m serious about this... I won’t let anyone tell me it’s just play!
I guess it must look like some game, huh...
[~ 163]
[~ 164]
Avit
Time for my pika-perfect smile!
Pika pika...
[~ 168]
[~ 169]
Kaelie
Me and my friends put in a lot of work to catch my Pokémon, but it was worth it!
But I worked hard with my friends to catch these Pokémon in the Wild Area!
[~ 173]
[~ 174]
Katherine
Perhaps now you appreciate my strength?
Oh dear!
[~ 178]
[~ 179]
Diego
You’re below the lower end of average.
I’m on the lower end of average, so I know my place.
[~ 183]
[~ 184]
Patton
Now that will burn off some calories!
The only ones getting a workout were my Pokémon!
[~ 188]
[~ 189]
Stella
That’ll get me likes!
Gonna make a post of me looking sad!
[~ 193]
[~ 194]
Krysia
I guess you’ll never find out what work I do!
I’m actually the department manager. We could use somebody like you on our team!
[~ 198]
[~ 199]
Matthew
I won that battle because I’m an early riser! Early to rise makes Pokémon healthy, as they say!
We were too sleepy to battle at full strength... I guess a well-rested Pokémon is never bested.
[~ 203]
[~ 204]
Winslow
It’s all about what moves your Pokémon know when you leave them at the Pokémon Nursery!
I wonder if Pokémon already know moves when they’re still inside Eggs?
[~ 208]
[~ 209]
Waylin
Love for your Pokémon is the key to victory!
Not enough love...? I need to love my Pokémon much more!
[~ 213]
[~ 214]
Therme
Easy peasy! Less trouble than work, that was!
I’m better at my work than I am at battling, I guess...
[~ 218]
[~ 219]
Columban
Victory third!
Defeat third! ...Wait, no—that’s not right.
[~ 223]
[~ 224]
Egbert
A smooth and comfortable victory, just like a well-maintained train!
Battling with Pokémon is nothing like maintaining trains, it seems...
[~ 228]
[~ 229]
Rikke
Told you we’ve got the heart for this!
Your nerves were stronger than ours...
[~ 233]
[~ 234]
Isabelle
Ha! I tricked you into thinking I was weak and helpless!
Oh come on. Did you think I was trying to pull one over on you or something?
[~ 238]
[~ 239]
Mornix
Hm. Maybe you should shower more often.
You are strong, just as I suspected! I wish to have a rematch sometime!
[~ 243]
[~ 244]
Tsapeli
Those online karate courses really paid off!
Maybe I should just learn Galarian karate the real way... I don’t like being hurt, though...
[~ 248]
[~ 249]
Jung
The mountains granted me victory! Mountains truly are the best places to be!
Wonderful! This gives me an excuse to spend even more time up in the mountains!
[~ 253]
[~ 254]
Graymond
That’s thanks to my ab-solute power! Though you can’t see my abs through my shirt.
Oh, I guess you can tell, huh? Yeah, I’m just wearing a lumpy shirt.
[~ 258]
[~ 259]
Celinda
This is such an interesting facility! Thanks for the battle!
I need to visit every tourist attraction in the Galar region!
[~ 263]
[~ 264]
Ajani
Aww, you let me win! That’s very nice of you!
*sob* That wasn’t very nice! My tears now stain the lands of Galar!
[~ 268]
[~ 269]
Feng
I had me a good tail wind, just like when you ride my Flying Taxi!
I keep battles and work separate, mate. You can always give me a call if you need a ride!
[~ 273]
[~ 274]
Daltz
Looks like you were headed for defeat!
Well, we’ve arrived at your victory!
[~ 278]
[~ 279]
Maggie
Aaaaaand I caught a big one!
Hmph! That was just beginner’s luck for you!
[~ 283]
[~ 284]
Bate
I’m even more partial to winning battles!
Not too fond of losing...
[~ 288]
[~ 289]
Nick
Oh, you’re just a small fry. You’re free to go!
Oh, I do beg your pardon... I didn’t realize you were the Champion.
[~ 293]
[~ 294]
Booker
Nothing to report here! All is well!
I ditched work to come here, only to get soundly defeated...
[~ 298]
[~ 299]
Astraea
A model needs to win with beauty!
I still have much to learn as a model...
[~ 303]
[~ 304]
Berti
My brilliance clearly has blinded you!
You’re really good! Say, why don’t you become a model?
[~ 308]
[~ 309]
Finn
A finely brewed victory for me!
Maybe you should come work at my shop!
[~ 313]
[~ 314]
Vassallo
A truly rich and refined battle... Well? What do you think?
You’re still so young, and yet your battle style is so rich and deep...
[~ 318]
[~ 319]
Isla
And that is how true nobility handle themselves in Pokémon battles.
I suggest you be extra careful when wandering around at night...
[~ 323]
[~ 324]
Laguna
Your Pokémon are... Well, they’re not bad, but not what I want.
I want your Pokémon! Please, would you be willing to part with them? No?
[~ 328]
[~ 329]
Gig
My Pokémon are good and strong! That’s why I sing this song! ♪
So we lost the battle and... ♪ Uh... I can’t think of any good rhymes.
[~ 333]
[~ 334]
Jay
Thank you, thank you! Thank you very much!
Whoa, stop! Stop the music right now!
[~ 338]
[~ 339]
Tricia
Backup dancers can provide synergy! All we need to do is dance, dance, and dance!
Blast! I was supposed to make the main performers shine!
[~ 343]
[~ 344]
Tiff
I’m so happy, I could do an improvised dance right here!
You had me dancing in the palm of your hand...
[~ 348]
[~ 349]
Noel
See? This is exactly what I mean.
The problem is that strong Trainers like you just show up out of nowhere!
[~ 353]
[~ 354]
Maya
What? I won? No WAY!
Now I can brag to my friends that I was defeated by the Champion h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imerself!
[~ 358]
[~ 359]
York
I did it! I hope my girlfriend’s winning her way up, too.
Waaah! What am I supposed to tell my girlfriend?
[~ 363]
[~ 364]
Gelete
Hee hee! I hope my boyfriend’s able to win like this, too!
*sniff* Fine, then! I’ll just vent to my boyfriend!
[~ 368]
[~ 369]
Savvas
My evasiveness rose sharply!
Some of your Pokémon’s moves grazed me...
[~ 373]
[~ 374]
Madi
Hee hee hee. Just what I wanted!
My mum always says that to my dad!
[~ 378]
[~ 379]
Keanu
*sigh* I keep getting better at Pokémon, but...
You and your Pokémon seem to have a lot of fun in battles!
[~ 383]
[~ 384]
Hertz
WE ARE VICTORIOUS. I GIVE THANKS TO MY POKÉMON.
I WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HUMAN SOUL...
[~ 388]
[~ 389]
Raise
You need to raise them more!
They’re well raised—that’s for sure!
[~ 393]

Madlyn
Good babies! Such good babies!
Hey, don’t be mean to my babies!
[~ 398]
[~ 399]
Cornelius
Here, just watch me flex!
I’m not as tough as I look? Oh come on. Don’t say that...
[~ 403]
[~ 404]
Ann
Well, that worked out all right! If I win, that’s all that matters!
I’m gonna stop you right there. You’re too strong for your own good!
[~ 408]
[~ 409]
Davis
Maybe not the best motive to start a job, but it’s sure made me stronger!
I guess it’s just a myth that being a League staff member makes you popular...
[~ 413]
[~ 414]
Oratoria
Hey, don’t make me seem harsh!
Your Pokémon, the way you battle—it’s all so grating!
[~ 418]
[~ 419]
Wenson
The operation is over.
I get very uneasy if I don’t have my scalpel with me.
[~ 423]
[~ 424]
Lia
Hmm, it seems like they could do with a little bit more strength...
They’re fit as a fiddle! Nothing to worry about at all!
[~ 428]
[~ 429]
Elwood
Art and battling, battling and art... Do you understand now?
No need to get so worked up! I’m just making stuff up as I go!
[~ 433]
[~ 434]
Mika
You’re so adorable! I hope we can battle again sometime!
Your battle style isn’t cute at all.
[~ 438]
[~ 439]
Wellington
What I just showed you is the proper, gentlemanly etiquette for battle.
Keep it together, me... You’re a gentleman... A gentleman... Blast it all!
[~ 443]
[~ 444]
Fairamay
You’re such a sweet child, letting an old lady like me win and all!
Oh deary me, I look away and I’ve already lost!
[~ 448]
[~ 449]
McKinzie
I don’t literally wear lots of hats, you know.
They say that he who chases two Meowth catches none. I guess that’s true...
[~ 453]
[~ 454]
Walden
I’m desperate to keep my place here. I can’t lose!
Are you going to take away the one place I fit in?!
[~ 458]
[~ 459]
Waldna
You’re the same as everyone else. Such a shame.
You... You’re not bad.
[~ 463]
[~ 464]
Rennie
See? I told you! I’m a proper lady!
Maybe I lost because I don’t have enough pocket money...
[~ 468]
[~ 469]
Curon
A bam and a crash, just like that!
Whaaaaaat?!
[~ 473]
[~ 474]
Cadet
I win, and then I battle another, stronger Trainer, and...it just keeps going.
I see it now! When you lose, you get frustrated, so you become stronger and try again!
[~ 478]
[~ 479]
Agila
I know my dream will come true if I keep doing my best!
I won’t let one defeat bring me down! I’m serious about my dream!
[~ 483]
[~ 484]
Laelia
Oh, I’m just joking. My age hasn’t even reached double digits yet!
A battle is fine and all, but I was hoping you’d at least react to that joke...
[~ 488]
[~ 489]
Freeman
I send out my Pokémon, select effective moves... and win.
Agh! My routine!
[~ 493]
[~ 494]
Marvo
Wrong stop or not, I had fun! I guess it’s good to take a breather now and then.
Getting defeated in the Battle Tower... You know, it was actually kind of refreshing.
[~ 498]
[~ 499]
Prudence
Eek! I hope I didn’t upset you...
Eek! Did you just think I was too self-conscious?
[~ 503]
[~ 504]
Russet
Another victory for cuteness!
My Pokémon are still adorable!
[~ 508]
[~ 509]
Gunter
Can you guess which station I work at?
What a surprise! Children learn and grow so fast...
[~ 513]
[~ 514]
Frost
Watch out for my Pokémon as we accelerate toward victory!
Your Pokémon were amazing... like an express train!
[~ 518]
[~ 519]
Tayster
I win! Now, you must taste my latest dish!
I was hoping I could get you to try my cooking if I’d won...
[~ 523]
[~ 524]
Brodo
Grazie!
Oh! I don’t actually season my Pokémon, you know!
[~ 528]
[~ 529]
Alby
I’m a wandering day laborer. Don’t let my mystery and charm enamor you!
Dug myself into a hole there!

Ultan
Some moves become more powerful if the Pokémon using them is heavy!
Some moves become more powerful if the Pokémon being hit is heavy!

Cyl
Doesn’t matter much to me, really. I like working with metal, too!
Oh well, I’ve had worse days.
[~ 543]
[~ 544]
Mason
Whew! A refreshing victory!
A helmet can get dreadfully hot inside...
[~ 548]
[~ 549]
Claus
Critical hits deal an extra 50 percent damage!
Critical hits only land about 4 percent of the time...
[~ 553]
[~ 554]
Harvey
I won on two hours of sleep! Only two hours, I tell you!
I lost ’cause I’m sleepy... Only two hours of sleep will do that...
[~ 558]
[~ 559]
Aya
Well, I thought you looked strong, but...
Ha! I knew you were strong! I told you I could tell!
[~ 563]
[~ 564]
Rachael
I think I’m gonna head home and loaf around with my Pokémon now.
See, this is why I didn’t wanna battle in the first place! I’m going home to veg out!
[~ 568]
[~ 569]
North
Aaaaaand cut! That was perfect!
Take two! Take two! Uh...no take two?
[~ 573]

Selmer
I’ll send you the video later.
I’m so zoomed in, I can’t see a thing!

Please, tell me how you feel about your defeat!
OK then, now for that interview... Wait—what? It’s over? We’re out of time?!
[~ 583]

Narra
Now I should interview myself about my amazing victory!
Uh, well then... Back to you folks at the studio!

Hee hee... That was a great way to get my pulse up!
Must...swallow...my pride...

This is how I gain more fans! Wasn’t that easy?
Hey, I wasn’t supposed to become YOUR fan!

Heaton
I hope you enjoyed my wide selection of moves.
I’m afraid my move sampling event is coming to its end...
[~ 603]
[~ 604]
Rister
I’d be happy to have a chat about your Pokémon team whenever you’d like.
A truly impressive assortment of moves! I’ll see you again in the Pokémon Center!
[~ 608]
[~ 609]
Crawly
Each meeting is a miracle! Thank you for adding a little bit more brilliance to my life.
Whether I win or lose doesn’t really matter. Either way, I grow as a person!
[~ 613]
[~ 614]
Lila
Whew! That helped me blow off steam. So, uh... What was I doing again?
Agh! I’m all flustered! How am I suppose to follow leads now?!
[~ 618]

Desmond
That’ll be 2,000,000 per ticket! Oh, but each one does come with a drink!
Pleeease, you gotta buy a ticket! I’ve got so many left over!

I lost the rhythm! A slow tempo throws me off...

Mum, Dad, I’ll be home soon!
No, you don’t understand—I WANT to go home! Please, let me go home!

Maybe you’re a bit young to join the police, eh?
You’ve definitely got the talent! Sure you don’t want to join us?

Heh, sorry ’bout that. I was just thinkin’ back to the old days.
Whoa now... You’re more off the rails than I was!

I-I was so nervous, I couldn’t hold back!
Oof! But you’re strong! I’d like to battle you again someday!

Bartholomew
Shorts make you strong! Feel the bracing air about your legs, and remember that!
I’m the one to blame here, not the shorts! The shorts did nothing wrong!
[~ 668]
[~ 669]
Laramie
There are more important things than tests. For me, my Pokémon are one of those things.
OK, guess it’s back to revising for me... Let’s see—16 times 16 equals 256, and...
[~ 673]
[~ 674]
Mindy
So did you hear me? It’s up to you to decide what you believe.
Crumbs! I spoke aloud!

Yes, yes, here it is: your defeat. Just sign here, would you?
Looks like someone nicked my victory...

Hahaha! See the difference that experience makes?
N-no! I think I threw my back out from the shock!

Fingal
Even if I can’t see through my glasses, I can easily find my way to victory!
Everything’s gone white! I can’t see a thing! Augh, these blasted glasses!
[~ 693]
[~ 694]
Niel
Come on, then. Give me your arm. It’ll just be a little poke...
B-but I want to give someone a jab! Why couldn’t you have just let me win?
[~ 698]

Angie
Hah! Don’t mind me while I soar above you!
Oh no! Looks like I’ve fallen from grace...

Nav
See? Got you to your defeat in no time at all.
See? I got you right ahead to the next match.
[~ 713]
[~ 714]
Tosh
You can tip me whatever you think I deserve. I think we both know I deserve plenty.
See? I was making sure you’d be comfortable by letting you win. So how about a tip?
[~ 718]
[~ 719]
Rei
What? You think something’s wrong with the way I raise my Pokémon?
Even in top condition, my Pokémon couldn’t win! What is this...?
[~ 723]
[~ 724]
Greta
See, it’s not enough to have a great specimen. You’ve got to know what to do with it.
Wow! You certainly know what to do with a great specimen, don’t you?
[~ 728]
[~ 729]
Chad
So...did you understand all that?
Yup! I got it! That really got through to me!
[~ 733]

Reese
How you raise your Pokémon has a lot to do with how they grow!
Please...teach me! I want to know how you’ve raised your Pokémon!

Thank you. And farewell.
That...that was the most pleasurable time I’ve experienced in a very long while.

If you spend your money right, you can become incredibly powerful! Gwahahaha!
M-my money...wasn’t enough?! Did I go wrong somewhere, or...?
[~ 748]

Navin
What a delightful feeling! This is what I never got to taste when every day was the same!
Getting to meet with new people like you is precisely what makes Pokémon so wonderful.
[~ 753]
[~ 754]
Tansy
Oh yes! Lovely! And winning is great for the skin as well. Takes 10 years right off you!
Oooh! You! Now how am I to face the other ladies at the club?!
[~ 758]
[~ 759]
Anselm
So, did you pick up how my Pokémon battle? Or were their moves too quick for you?
Now those were quite the moves you showed me!
[~ 763]
[~ 764]
Hardy
*scritch scritch* Oh, sorry... Did you attack? *scritch scritch* I didn’t even notice...
*scritch scritch* You scratched us right out... *scritch scritch* Guess I’ll focus on my carving...
[~ 768]
[~ 769]
Ulster
I didn’t even get to show off my moves... Maybe I should battle against Pokémon instead...
If only I’d been the one battling... That’s it! My team and I must undergo further training!

Wotson
Wot wot! How d’you like that, then?
Wotcher!

I certainly was able to read your mind. That’s how I reeled you right in.
My word, I couldn’t get a read on you! No wonder you’re the Champion...

Chelsea
Do you prefer sea fishing or river fishing? Favorite bait? Favorite lure?
Next let’s have a fishing battle! You will become my fishing buddy, won’t you?

Torren
The building’s name is actually Rose Tower, but everyone just calls it the Battle Tower!

And down I go... All the way down to rock bottom...

You were powerless before the great power of boundless nature!
Nature might be boundless, but it seems my power was not...
[~ 808]

Ulva
Oooh, sorry ’bout that! Guess I should’ve gone a bit easier on you?
I do like young ones who train their Pokémon up to be so strong, like you.

Polly
Please! I’m begging you! Just one night at the Rose of the Rondelands here in Wyndon!

Lazlo
And that’s what battle looks like when you don’t let up until the last move has been unleashed.
I lost my focus for a single second, and that was it... That was when the battle was lost for me...
[~ 823]
[~ 824]
Allegra
That was a jolly good time! Thanks! I love Pokémon—don’t you?
Even losing the battle, that was a jolly fun match! Let’s do it again sometime!

[~ 838]
[~ 839]

There’s no victory without sacrifice.

[~ 843]
[~ 844]
Eva
I can still ewolve more! But your Ewolution got canceled. Bye-bye!

[~ 848]
[~ 849]
Cooper
Our department is the best! Nothing better than being truly serious in everything that you do!
B-but our department goals... They won’t look leniently on this loss!
[~ 853]
[~ 854]
Becka
Ahhh! That’s the ticket! I feel so much better! All I need beside me is my Pokémon.
Now you’ve gone and broken my heart, too... At least I’ve still got my Pokémon beside me...
[~ 858]
[~ 859]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match! Is this really the best you can do?!
Battling against a Champion like you... It really is the best... And since you managed to defeat me, you’ll be moving up the ranks here at the Battle Tower.
[~ 863]
[~ 864]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match! Is this really the best you can do?!
I’m glad we’ve got such a strong Champion here in Galar, but even more than that... I’m gutted to have lost! Thanks for always giving me the chance to have the greatest battles. But I don’t plan on losing the next one!
[~ 868]
[~ 869]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match! Is this really the best you can do?!
You and your team are utterly brilliant. You’ve gone beyond me now... So it’s time we move you up a rank! But I don’t plan on sitting on my bum. The next time we meet in the Battle Tower, I’ll make you regret winning your way to facing me!
[~ 873]
[~ 874]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match! Is this really the best you can do?!
You never stop surprising me, you know that? I’m really astounded at how far you’ve come! Right then! Let’s move you up a rank! There are no limits when it comes to Pokémon! Keep on having a champion time!
[~ 878]
[~ 879]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match! Is this really the best you can do?!
When I’ve got you, and I’ve got Hop, and I’ve got Charizard beside me... I feel there’s no limit to how strong I can become! It’s just like I told you before... There’s truly no limit when it comes to Pokémon! We’re all going to have a champion time!

There is a plant seed on its back right from the day this Pokémon is born. The seed slowly grows larger.
When the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose the ability to stand on its hind legs.
Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.
It has a preference for hot things. When it rains, steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.
It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips its fiery tail around and slashes away with sharp claws.
It spits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders. It may cause forest fires by blowing flames.
When it retracts its long neck into its shell, it squirts out water with vigorous force.
It is recognized as a symbol of longevity. If its shell has algae on it, that Wartortle is very old.
It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause fainting. In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.
For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antenna on its head to drive away enemies.
It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this stage, it can only harden, so it remains motionless to avoid attack.
In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to release highly toxic dust into the air.












Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity have cheek sacs that are extra soft and super stretchy.
Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high-voltage power.
It loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, the Pokémon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body.
The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother the Pokémon’s spikes will feel when touched.
Females are more sensitive to smells than males. While foraging, they’ll use their whiskers to check wind direction and stay downwind of predators.
The horn on its head has atrophied. It’s thought that this happens so Nidorina’s children won’t get poked while their mother is feeding them.
Nidoqueen is better at defense than offense. With scales like armor, this Pokémon will shield its children from any kind of attack.
The horn on a male Nidoran’s forehead contains a powerful poison. This is a very cautious Pokémon, always straining its large ears.
With a horn that’s harder than diamond, this Pokémon goes around shattering boulders as it searches for a moon stone.
When it goes on a rampage, it’s impossible to control. But in the presence of a Nidoqueen it’s lived with for a long time, Nidoking calms down.
It is said that happiness will come to those who see a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a full moon.
A timid fairy Pokémon that is rarely seen, it will run and hide the moment it senses people.
While young, it has six gorgeous tails. When it grows, several new tails are sprouted.
It is said to live 1,000 years, and each of its tails is loaded with supernatural powers.
Jigglypuff has top-notch lung capacity, even by comparison to other Pokémon. It won’t stop singing its lullabies until its foes fall asleep.
The more air it takes in, the more it inflates. If opponents catch it in a bad mood, it will inflate itself to an enormous size to intimidate them.
It emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings. Even in tight caves, Zubat flies around with skill.
It loves to drink other creatures’ blood. It’s said that if it finds others of its kind going hungry, it sometimes shares the blood it’s gathered.
If exposed to moonlight, it starts to move. It roams far and wide at night to scatter its seeds.
Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor. The horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance of 1.25 miles.
It has the world’s largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen.




If a Diglett digs through a field, it leaves the soil perfectly tilled and ideal for planting crops.
A team of Diglett triplets. It triggers huge earthquakes by burrowing 60 miles underground.
It loves to collect shiny things. If it’s in a good mood, it might even let its Trainer have a look at its hoard of treasures.
Getting this prideful Pokémon to warm up to you takes a lot of effort, and it will claw at you the moment it gets annoyed.
Psyduck is constantly beset by headaches. If the Pokémon lets its strange power erupt, apparently the pain subsides for a while.
This Pokémon lives in gently flowing rivers. It paddles through the water with its long limbs, putting its graceful swimming skills on display.


It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.
The sight of it running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night has captivated many people.
For Poliwag, swimming is easier than walking. The swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of the Pokémon’s innards showing through the skin.
Staring at the swirl on its belly causes drowsiness. This trait of Poliwhirl’s has been used in place of lullabies to get children to go to sleep.
Its body is solid muscle. When swimming through cold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to smash through drift ice and plow forward.
This Pokémon uses its psychic powers while it sleeps. The contents of Abra’s dreams affect the powers that the Pokémon wields.
Using its psychic power, Kadabra levitates as it sleeps. It uses its springy tail as a pillow.
It has an incredibly high level of intelligence. Some say that Alakazam remembers everything that ever happens to it, from birth till death.
Its whole body is composed of muscles. Even though it’s the size of a human child, it can hurl 100 grown-ups.
Its muscular body is so powerful, it must wear a power-save belt to be able to regulate its motions.
It quickly swings its four arms to rock its opponents with ceaseless punches and chops from all angles.



Tentacool is not a particularly strong swimmer. It drifts across the surface of shallow seas as it searches for prey.
When the red orbs on Tentacruel’s head glow brightly, watch out. The Pokémon is about to fire off a burst of ultrasonic waves.



It can’t run properly when it’s newly born. As it races around with others of its kind, its legs grow stronger.
This Pokémon can be seen galloping through fields at speeds of up to 150 mph, its fiery mane fluttering in the wind.
Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pokémon won’t feel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won’t notice when its tail grows back, either.
Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.
At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and ends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a grounded Magnemite, it’ll start moving again.
This Pokémon is three Magnemite that have linked together. Magneton sends out powerful radio waves to study its surroundings.
The stalk this Pokémon carries in its wings serves as a sword to cut down opponents. In a dire situation, the stalk can also serve as food.






It swims facing backward by opening and closing its two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast.
Its shell is extremely hard. It cannot be shattered, even with a bomb. The shell opens only when it is attacking.
Born from gases, anyone would faint if engulfed by its gaseous body, which contains poison.
Its tongue is made of gas. If licked, its victim starts shaking constantly until death eventually comes.
On the night of a full moon, if shadows move on their own and laugh, it must be Gengar’s doing.
As it digs through the ground, it absorbs many hard objects. This is what makes its body so solid.


It can be found near the sea. The large pincers grow back if they are torn out of their sockets.
Its large and hard pincer has 10,000-horsepower strength. However, being so big, it is unwieldy to move.


Though it may look like it’s just a bunch of eggs, it’s a proper Pokémon. Exeggcute communicates with others of its kind via telepathy, apparently.
Each of Exeggutor’s three heads is thinking different thoughts. The three don’t seem to be very interested in one another.
When the memory of its departed mother brings it to tears, its cries echo mournfully within the skull it wears on its head.
This Pokémon overcame its sorrow to evolve a sturdy new body. Marowak faces its opponents bravely, using a bone as a weapon.
This amazing Pokémon has an awesome sense of balance. It can kick in succession from any position.
Its punches slice the air. They are launched at such high speed, even a slight graze could cause a burn.
If this Pokémon’s sticky saliva gets on you and you don’t clean it off, an intense itch will set in. The itch won’t go away, either.
Its body is full of poisonous gas. It floats into garbage dumps, seeking out the fumes of raw, rotting trash.
It mixes gases between its two bodies. It’s said that these Pokémon were seen all over the Galar region back in the day.
Strong, but not too bright, this Pokémon can shatter even a skyscraper with its charging tackles.
It begins walking on its hind legs after evolution. It can punch holes through boulders with its horn.
The egg Chansey carries is not only delicious but also packed with nutrition. It’s used as a high-class cooking ingredient.
Hidden beneath a tangle of vines that grows nonstop even if the vines are torn off, this Pokémon’s true appearance remains a mystery.
Although it’s carrying its baby in a pouch on its belly, Kangaskhan is swift on its feet. It intimidates its opponents with quick jabs.
Horsea makes its home in oceans with gentle currents. If this Pokémon is under attack, it spits out pitch-black ink and escapes.
It’s the males that raise the offspring. While Seadra are raising young, the spines on their backs secrete thicker and stronger poison.
Its dorsal, pectoral, and tail fins wave elegantly in water. That is why it is known as the Water Dancer.
In autumn, its body becomes more fatty in preparing to propose to a mate. It takes on beautiful colors.
If you visit a beach at the end of summer, you’ll be able to see groups of Staryu lighting up in a steady rhythm.
This Pokémon has an organ known as its core. The organ glows in seven colors when Starmie is unleashing its potent psychic powers.
The broadness of its hands may be no coincidence—many scientists believe its palms became enlarged specifically for pantomiming.
As Scyther fights more and more battles, its scythes become sharper and sharper. With a single slice, Scyther can fell a massive tree.
In certain parts of Galar, Jynx was once feared and worshiped as the Queen of Ice.
Many power plants keep Ground-type Pokémon around as a defense against Electabuzz that come seeking electricity.
Magmar dispatches its prey with fire. But it regrets this habit once it realizes that it has burned its intended prey to a charred crisp.
These Pokémon judge one another based on pincers. Thicker, more impressive pincers make for more popularity with the opposite gender.
When Tauros begins whipping itself with its tails, it’s a warning that the Pokémon is about to charge with astounding speed.
It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic Pokémon in the world.
It has an extremely aggressive nature. The Hyper Beam it shoots from its mouth totally incinerates all targets.
A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.
It can reconstitute its entire cellular structure to change into what it sees, but it returns to normal when it relaxes.
It has the ability to alter the composition of its body to suit its surrounding environment.
When Vaporeon’s fins begin to vibrate, it is a sign that rain will come within a few hours.
If it is angered or startled, the fur all over its body bristles like sharp needles that pierce foes.
Once it has stored up enough heat, this Pokémon’s body temperature can reach up to 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
State-of-the-art technology was used to create Porygon. It was the first artificial Pokémon to be created via computer programming.
Because some Omanyte manage to escape after being restored or are released into the wild by people, this species is becoming a problem.
Weighed down by a large and heavy shell, Omastar couldn’t move very fast. Some say it went extinct because it was unable to catch food.
This species is almost entirely extinct. Kabuto molt every three days, making their shells harder and harder.
Kabutops slices its prey apart and sucks out the fluids. The discarded body parts become food for other Pokémon.

Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its scales together and roars. Its sharp claws shred the opposition.
Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors wearing armor made of Kommo-o scales.

It needs light to survive, and it goes on a rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces.

This Pokémon can conceal itself in any shadow, so it went undiscovered for a long time.




Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs. Wherever Zeraora runs, lightning flashes and thunder echoes.
They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve.
Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.
It attacks with rapid beats of its stick. As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets more and more pumped.
When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent.
The one with the best drumming techniques becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle disposition and values harmony among its group.

It kicks berries right off the branches of trees and then juggles them with its feet, practicing its footwork.

The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar regional specialty.
If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pokémon is surprisingly strong.

This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and take them down.

By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over 18 mph. The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area.

It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a powerful acid. It can also change its shape into that of an apple.
Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack.
It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide.
Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently.
This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey.

It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.
It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.

While its burning body is already dangerous on its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has large and very sharp fangs.
Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.
Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea.
The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its home is a famous piece of antique tableware. Many forgeries are in circulation.
Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist.
If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas without people.
Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer.

It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things and feasting on the negative energy of the frustrated occupants.
With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow.

It evolved after experiencing numerous fights. While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that would make any opponent flinch.
After many battles, it evolved dangerous claws that come together to form daggers when extended.
Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it.
After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food.

It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow.

Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle.

These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder.
The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.
This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.
Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater.
The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway.
The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.
If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.
Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy.
Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.
This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals.

Glastrier has tremendous physical strength, and the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times harder than diamond.
As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves silence and solitude.
Calyrex is known in legend as a king that ruled over Galar in ancient times. It has the power to cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth.

The flame inside its body burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When Charizard roars, that temperature climbs even higher.

Water fired from this Pokémon’s central main cannon has enough power to blast a hole into a mountain.
Once it has opponents trapped in a tornado that could blow away a 10-ton truck, it finishes them off with its poisonous scales.

This Pokémon Trainer got endorsed to take part in the Gym Challenge by his brother— the reigning Champion, Leon. Hop claims to have watched all Leon’s matches. Commentators speculate that as a result, he might be quite the force to be reckoned with. The Champion himself has said that his brother has potential, but his carefully hoarded knowledge can go to waste as he tends to get easily flustered in battle. It’s said that Hop’s partner Wooloo is a great help to him both in battle and with chores around the house.
This Trainer ultimately was defeated in the final match of the Champion Cup Semifinals. However, many Gym Leaders speak highly of his battle style, where he will let his Pokémon battle freely and really enjoy themselves. During the incident with Eternatus, he provided vital assistance in resolving the situation, proving beyond doubt that he is a skilled Trainer in his own right. It is expected that his battles with the new Champion will be the stuff of legend.

As a child, she was timid and a bit of a crybaby. However, she became more cheerful as she played with the Pokémon she received from her brother, and her talents as a Trainer also grew greatly. She joined the Gym Challenge because she wishes to breathe life back into her dilapidated hometown, but she says she has been somewhat distracted by the boutiques throughout Galar. Though many in Spikemuth see her as a local celebrity, she herself has no interest in pursuing fame. However, she says she does appreciate the support of Team Yell, her personal cheering squad.
She was appointed as the new Gym Leader of Spikemuth by her brother Piers. Piers caught Morpeko and gave it to her when she was five. She still finds herself at the mercy of Morpeko’s mood swings even now. The local dialect of Spikemuth has a distinct kick to it, and many of Marnie’s fans have started mimicking her. Marnie won’t change her expression even when she gets angry, but once something sets her off, she stays angry for a long time.

This Trainer was born as the son of farmers. He has honed his strength, stamina, and skill as a Pokémon Trainer from a young age by working together with his Pokémon. Because of his gentle nature, he has trouble going all out on weaker opponents, which is why his Gym is the first one for challengers to attempt during the Gym Challenge. He always wears his boots, as apparently they let him dig in his heels when he needs to.
Though his record isn’t the best due to his focus on simply having fun in battles, Milo himself is incredibly strong. The rolls of hay used in his Gym Challenge each weigh over 770 pounds, yet Milo can roll them around easily. Wooloo tend to roll around, too, and sometimes they can get carried away and roll out of the Gym Stadium. It has become common in Turffield to see the whole town chasing after Milo, who is in turn chasing after a stray Wooloo, along with Yamper.

Her father is a fisher, and her mother works in the marketplace. Perhaps because of her parents, she grew up playing with Water-type Pokémon and eventually made it all the way to being a Gym Leader. She met Sonia during their Gym Challenge, and they continue to be close friends. Nessa often gives Sonia fresh seafood from Hulbury. She has declared that Milo of Turffield is her rival, but Milo responded by saying that his rival is himself.
Nessa is incredibly popular, both as a Gym Leader and as a model. Many people even think the Gym Leader Nessa and the model Nessa are two different people, since she shows a completely different attitude in each role. She had the misfortune of being defeated in the first match of the Finals, and those who knew of her indomitable nature worried that this would impact her work as a model. Despite her loss, she was still able to give her fans a perfect smile. Things were not nearly as peaceful with her Gym, however...

Kabu is a Pokémon Trainer who was invited from the Hoenn region. There were a few times where he was very close to becoming Champion, but victory always seemed to elude him at the last moment. Because of this, he adopted a no-holds-barred approach to battling for a time, but even that did not bring the results he wanted. He even dropped to the minor division at one point, but after a fantastic battle with Leon, he regained faith in his own potential. His motto is to keep learning and training as long as he is alive.
Interview with Challenger Kabu Q: How do you see your own battle style? Kabu: Just, straightforward, direct. I’m still young, so I try to keep things simple. Just burn as hot as I can, you know? Still, I’ve hit a bit of a losing streak, so I’ve tried incorporating Will-O-Wisp into my Pokémon’s move set. That’s one thing I want to tell everyone—experiment with every possibility of your Pokémon. Moves, Abilities, items... Try everything, and there’s sure to be a path forward!

Given special attention from her parents, Bea trained hard with her partner Pokémon since a very young age. This has honed her judgment skills, and she is able to remain calm and collected even when facing dire situations in battle. This leads many to think she lacks emotion, but the truth seems to be that she doesn’t want to show weakness. She is sometimes known to show her true feelings to her partner Pokémon during battles. She is secretly a huge fan of various sweets, and this has recently been found out by her fans. The additional attention has made enjoying sweets a little difficult.
In order to become strong, one must face opponents who are stronger than oneself. Even if defeat seems inevitable, Bea will still go all out and try to at least draw. It’s possible that the strict (one might even say too strict) training from her stern parents has left a burden on young Bea, taking away her smile. So, who has seen Bea smile? Her family? Her Pokémon? Or maybe someone else entirely...

He is a young, mysterious Trainer who has taken on the mantle of Gym Leader at a very young age. He has never been known to remove his mask in public. In fact, he has at least one hundred masks of the same design, just to keep spares handy should his mask fall off for some reason. He claims to have developed the ability to see deceased Ghost-type Pokémon after an accident he had when he was four years old, but the truth is still a mystery.
This is a photo that happened to capture Allister in his locker room. He can be seen clutching the mask that normally hides his face, no doubt confronting the fears and insecurities he feels within. Even though he has taken the role of Gym Leader at a very young age, it is clear that off the pitch he is still very much a normal boy. However, one mystery remains—nobody knows who took this photo. Some even claim it was the work of Ghost-type Pokémon.

Opal is the oldest Gym Leader in the Galar region. She took over for her mother 70 years ago and has kept the position since. However, she feels that her own values have reached their limits, and thus she is currently looking for a worthy successor. She claims that she gives deliberately tricky quizzes because people reveal their true colors when in a pinch, but many speculate that in reality, she does it out of pure spite.
Opal has thrust the duties of Gym Leader onto Bede, who had his Gym Challenger status revoked. That being said, she still shows up at the Gym Stadium every day, giving unsolicited advice, coming up with new quiz questions, and practicing various performances. What is this “pink” she insisted others show her? Maybe a clue lies in a comment she made during an old interview. “Keep thinking about the right answer, and eventually you’ll create the right answer.”

Gordie is a young rising star that many suspect will be the Champion someday. Though Rock-type Pokémon are typically known for being rough and unrelenting, Gordie has worked hard to achieve victory through a refined and graceful battle style. He always tries to keep his fans happy and thus is very popular among the audience. On the other hand, he has the surprising tendency of shutting himself away in the locker room when he is defeated, making postdefeat interviews a rarity. This doesn’t bother most of his fans, though, and they see this behavior as endearing.
Gordie is one of the top Trainers of the Galar region, both in terms of popularity and skill. His strict training style means that his Gym has few Gym Trainers, but he does have quite a fan base. Gordie does his best to make sure his fans are happy, often seen giving out autographs or hosting events. There are currently three photo albums of Gordie, all published through the support of his fan base. This card shows another special photo, taken specifically for this purpose at a photo studio.

Melony has been a Gym Leader since she was in her twenties. She is also known as a very effective coach, but her coaching style is incredibly strict. Her battle style is fittingly severe and stoic, as well. Any Gym Trainers who manage to remain under Melony are sure to be powerful opponents. Thus many see Circhester Stadium as a major roadblock for Gym Challengers. Many quietly speculate that Melony’s harsh battle style is due to a fight she had with her son.
Melony wanted Gordie to take over as the Gym Leader of Circhester, while Gordie wanted to dedicate himself to Rock-type Pokémon. The Pokémon battle between the two ended up dividing the whole town. Ever since that day, Melony and Gordie hardly ever see each other. That being said, Melony supposedly managed to become the first member of Gordie’s fan club. Gordie seems to have a complicated expression in their photo together, but then again, that may just be one’s own imagination...

Spikemuth lacks a Power Spot that would allow Pokémon to Dynamax, and thus not many fans come to visit the town. Piers feels responsible for allowing his town to fall into obscurity and dilapidation. Once in battle, Piers tends to get riled up and will often reveal his strategy early on, but he has the strength and skill to triumph regardless. However, his true passions are singing and song writing, and his talents in these fields are well-known. As such, he currently hopes that his younger sister will take over as Gym Leader.
Here are some words from Piers when he first became the Gym Leader of Spikemuth. “Uh... ... ... The name’s Piers. It’s too bad we can’t Dynamax our Pokémon in Spikemuth, but you could say we have a more authentic style of Pokémon battles. And I plan on showin’ that off. And well... I have a younger sister, and she’s got way more talent than me. But until she’s old enough to become Gym Leader, I’ll keep rockin’ with my crew and make sure Spikemuth stays lively!”

Raihan is commonly regarded as the most skilled Gym Leader in the Galar region. He has striven for victory in every environment, and as a result, he has adopted a battle style where he utilizes weather effects to their fullest. It is rumored that he could easily become another region’s Champion should he choose to move, but it seems that to Raihan, defeating Leon is much more important. His uploaded selfies are quite popular. Occasionally he’ll post a photo that only shows a sandstorm.
Raihan started taking selfies so as to never forget the pain of his defeats, but more recently he has been taking photos showing off his training routine, his fashion choices, and the like, causing some fans to leave harsh comments whenever he loses to Leon. It’s true that Raihan is on a ten-nil losing streak against Leon, but no other Pokémon Trainer has managed to KO as many of Leon’s Pokémon as Raihan has. Raihan no doubt looks forward to taking a selfie after finally defeating Leon.

Leon is known far and wide for taking part in the Gym Challenge at the tender age of 10 years old—and even more so for claiming victory in the Champion Cup on his first attempt. Ever since that victory, he and his partner Charizard have remained unbeaten in both League and exhibition matches. He is called “the unbeatable Champion” and is a hero to many Trainers. He has but one weakness: a dismal sense of direction. But don’t worry—wherever he ends up, he makes sure everyone has a champion time!
Leon’s dream, even when he was still the Champion, was to make Galarian Trainers the strongest Trainers in the world. In order to fulfill that dream, he has rebuilt Rose Tower into the Battle Tower, a facility dedicated to Pokémon battles. People say that he seems even more lively now than he was as Champion. Leon has also commented that another reason he likes the tower so much is because it’s impossible to get lost inside. Leon’s biggest problem now is apparently coming up with a new signature catchphrase to replace “Let’s have a champion time!”

Mr. Rose is in fact a talented Trainer, coming in second place for a past Champion Cup. As the chairman of the Pokémon League, and as the president of a large business conglomerate, he is truly a hero to the Galar region, working tirelessly to ensure its prosperity. His thoughts and words don’t always match, and thus many say it’s hard to tell what he’s talking about. In fact, it is said that only his secretary can tell what his true intent is. (NOTE: The above text was submitted by his secretary.)
Chairman Rose is a dedicated philanthropist who spent much of his own time and money researching the ancient disaster known as the Darkest Day, all in order to solve Galar’s energy issues. He firmly believes that actions speak louder than words and will often make decisions without revealing his thinking to others. For better or for worse, it is this style of leadership that has allowed the Macro Cosmos conglomerate to grow to where it is today. (NOTE: The above text was submitted by his secretary.)

Bede spent some time living in an orphanage after his family ran into some trouble when he was young. He always had difficulty getting along with others and would constantly get into fights. That is until one day Chairman Rose visited the facility. Rose gave Bede a Pokémon, which changed Bede’s life forever. He showed talent as a Trainer and threw himself into Pokémon battles, becoming stronger by the day. He has joined the Gym Challenge with an endorsement from the chairman himself, and Bede plans to prove that the chairman’s faith was not misplaced.
He was appointed by the former Gym Leader Opal to become the new Gym Leader of Ballonlea Stadium. The general consensus is that Opal’s harsh training has in fact mellowed him out. Though he himself has never confirmed nor denied this, it should be noted that he no longer refuses to give autographs. Additionally, it seems his skills as a Pokémon Trainer have also increased rather dramatically. Recently, his intrusion during the Finals of the Champion Cup has gained popularity, and fans wish to see that kind of performance again. Bede himself is not sure how to react.

This mysterious figure has taken it upon himself (herself?) to dress up in the fashion of the Pokémon League’s official mascot. The mysterious individual is known to many as “the Ball Guy” but in point of fact, all are mystified when it comes to this person’s true identity or age or even gender. While the Ball Guy is known for her (his?) habit of handing out rare Poké Balls here and there around Galar, it’s a mystery as to why or even where these balls come from. It’s all very mystifying...

Mustard is the former Fighting-type Gym Leader and is regarded as one of the strongest Champions in Galar’s history— reigning undefeated for 18 years. His intense drive for strength meant he insisted on discipline, both in himself and in others. His character changed drastically, however, after his post-retirement globe-trotting. His sudden purchase of a deserted island added to the surprise of those around him. When asked for his reasoning, he answered with a smile, “There are lots of ways to be strong in this world. I want to see them all!” The name “Isle of Armor” was also his idea.
This photo was taken about 50 years ago, when Mustard defeated the Fairy-type Gym Leader and went on to become Champion. He reigned undefeated until he lost his partner Pokémon. After this, his losses started to mount. He remained popular even after losing the mantle of Champion, but decided to retire after the league chairman at that time asked him to win in a rigged match. Mustard developed an obsession with video games after his retirement. Apparently he held off while he was still active in order to maintain his image to his fans.
Honey is the former CEO of a trading firm. She met Mustard while visiting Galar during one of her many business trips, and it was love at first sight. They were married shortly afterward. She now works as the dojo matron—cooking, cleaning, advertising, and taking care of finances. She also keeps an eye on the mental health of students. What’s more, she’s also the creator of Max Soup. She used the forest mushrooms in her soup as a way to cut costs, and this caused her Pokémon to Gigantamax. Her latest ambition is to sell ready-made Max Soup across the world. Her motto is teamwork.
Honey wasn’t a Trainer initially, but after spending time with Mustard, she tried it out on a whim. She quickly developed a talent for battle, and the rumor among dojo students is that she may even be on par with Mustard himself. Thanks to taking care of very powerful Pokémon at the dojo, Honey has also gained a lot of physical strength of her own. Now she can handle even powerful Pokémon, like Gallade.
Avery comes from a long-standing family of psychics. Each Psychic-type Gym Leader of Galar has been from the same bloodline as Avery, and thus, Avery has been destined to bear the burden of Gym Leader since even before he was born. Ever since he was a child, Avery could freely move things with his mind but lacked other skills, such as teleportation or telepathy. This has caused the rest of his family to label him as a disappointment. Avery has a great deal of respect for Slowpoke, as they go about their business at their own pace, no matter what others say.
Avery has always been very proud and would levitate any opponent who dared defeat him. This behavior caused his status as a Gym Trainer to be revoked. During this time of despair and desperation, his Slowpoke found a flyer for the Master Dojo, leading to Avery’s current circumstances. Avery caused friction with many of the other students initially, but the kindness of Honey and Mustard slowly helped him to mellow out and become more friendly. Recently he has been training hard with his now-evolved Slowbro to prove himself better than a certain new student at the dojo.
Klara was originally an underground pop singer. She promoted herself as a star that had both cuteness and the virulence of poison. She energetically held live concerts and other events, even selling some Klara- themed collectibles that she made herself, but in spite of everything, she only managed to sell eight copies of her debut album “Krazy for Klara.” She decided becoming a Gym Leader would help her gain more popularity and has been working toward that goal since. She chose the Poison type because it matched her image and there was less competition.
The training at the Poison-type Gym was a lot harsher than Klara was ready for, and she gave up after two days. It was during this time she saw an ad for the Master Dojo during a late-night TV show. The master seemed kind, and Klara thought it would help her become strong without having to try too hard, so she immediately called in to apply. Normally, Klara’s sole focus is to be doted on by others, so she puts only the bare minimum into her training, but recently a new student at the dojo has caused a change of attitude. She now works secretly with her Slowbro to better herself.
Peony is a former Steel-type Gym Leader. His powerful and dynamic battle style meant that anyone stuck on pitch maintenance had their work cut out for them. To this day, he is known as “Steel Peony” and has many fans, especially among men. This photo is actually a composite photo, made before Peony came to the Crown Tundra. It was originally a poster Peony stuck in the travel planner he made for his daughter, but she threw it away in short order. Peony liked the way it looked and decided to use it for his League Card.
Though this is seldom addressed publicly, Peony is, in fact, Rose’s younger brother. Peony was compared to his brilliant older brother since he was born, causing him to gradually rebel and become a delinquent. He eventually ran away from home, only to become a Gym Leader once his talent was recognized. He was even Champion once, but shortly afterward, Rose became League Chairman. This caused Peony to vanish entirely from the League. The Copperajah on Peony’s team has been there since it was a Cufant. It was the first Pokémon Peony caught together with his brother.
