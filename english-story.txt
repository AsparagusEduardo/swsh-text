Do you know the Pokémon Furfrou? If you have one, I’ll trim it for you for 500!
Knock it off! You don’t have 500!

If you want to try out a different style, come back any time.
Want me to trim Furfrou a bit to maintain its [VAR 0194(0000)]?
Want me to return your Furfrou to its natural look, huh?
Knock it off! I can’t trim an Egg!
I only feel love for Furfrou. I won’t trim any other Pokémon!
Hmmm? Hmmm? That won’t change anything, though.
Poodle Pokémon with fluffy fur... My fingers are itching to trim Furfrou so bad.

Welcome, one and all!
Welcome to the wonderful world of Pokémon!
Our beloved Galar region is a wonderful place, with thriving nature...
beautiful cities, and many Pokémon with which we share our lives!
As you know, our society is able to thrive...
thanks to help from these mysterious creatures that we call Pokémon.
Yes, Pokémon are all around us—in the sea, in the sky, and even with us in our towns!
And those of us who choose to raise and train Pokémon to do battle and compete...
we call Pokémon Trainers!
Oh! But I’m getting carried away. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rose, and it is a pleasure to be here.
Now turn your gaze to the Galar region’s greatest Pokémon Trainer, your undefeated Champion...
It’s time for Champion Leon’s exhibition match!
Exhibition or not, Leon, your pristine record is about to end—when I beat you here today!

The chairman is tied up with some business, so I hope no one minds me stepping in on his behalf...
in order to lead you all to greater heights as Pokémon Trainers of the Galar region!

But I’m in a bit of a pickle. The energy released by the Darkest Day is too much for us to contain.
I’m sorry it’s come to this. But it’s you who forced my hand, Leon. You refused to listen!

Congratulations, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
You’ve beat even the unbeatable Champion— making you the new Champion of the region!
You’ve become a first-rate Trainer, all right.
I offer you my heartfelt congratulations!
And now that you’ve grown so strong, perhaps it’s time I started looking ahead myself.
It’s time we adults started working on improving the here and now, for the sake of all that’s to come!
And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! What you ought to do now is...
believe in yourself and your partner Pokémon, and keep on blasting ahead!
In order to create that bright future we all hope to see!
People of Galar!
Here you have it! A new legend born right before your eyes!
Your Champion, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Bet you can’t wait to see what kind of future a kid with this kind of strength might bring about!
I sure can’t! Let’s watch and see what [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she can do!

I see. Well, let me know if you change your mind!
Hooray! It’s the Galarian Meowth of my dreams! I’ll take such good care of it! Depending on the region, some Pokémon may have a different appearance or types!
Thanks for the Galarian Meowth! How is Cash?
Huh? You’ve only got one Pokémon! You’ll need at least two Pokémon if you want to trade.

Say, if you’ve got a Bunnelby...would you like to trade it for my Skwovet?
Oh my, you’re going to trade that one?
Oh dear, that’s too bad!
I’ll take great care of your Bunnelby! So take care of my Skwovet, too!
I’m looking after the Bunnelby you traded me with great care!
You’ve only got one Pokémon? You’ll need to have at least two in order to trade!

You got a Minccino? Interested in tradin’ it for my Cottonee?
You fine with tradin’ that Minccino with me?
No good, huh?
Thanks, mate! You just made my day! I’ll take real good care of it!
Minccino’s doin’ great! Take good care of my Cottonee!
Wait a tic. You’ve only got one Pokémon to battle with. You can only trade if you got at least two.

Toxel are so cool. I really, really want one. If you’ve got a Toxel, would you please trade it for my Togepi?
So cool! You’re really going to trade me that Toxel?
Yeah, I get it. Toxel are so cool there’s no way you’d trade me one...
Hooray! A Toxel! Just like I’ve always wanted! I promise to take good care of it!
Toxel is growing really well. Pokémon you get in trades are easy to raise.
You can’t trade if you’ve only got one party Pokémon. Please come back when you’ve got at least two.

Hey there. You happen to catch a lot of Maractus? How about trading one for my Hatenna?
You good with trading that one?
Come back if you change your mind.
All right! What a great trade! A give and take between Trainers!
A Pokémon you have a lot of might be a rare Pokémon to someone else. That’s when a trade might be in order.
You’ve only got one Pokémon, so you can’t trade. Bring some more Pokémon with you if you want to trade.

Have you caught any Yamask in Galar? If you have, would you be interested in trading for the Yamask I caught abroad?
Are you OK with trading me that Yamask?
Oh no... I’m so sad.
Hehe. What a great trade!
Is the super-rare Yamask that I caught behaving itself?
It’s kind of hard to trade when you’ve only got one Pokémon with you. Please come back when you’ve got more.

I’d really fancy catching a Vanillish, but catching Pokémon is a young person’s game, by gum. I sure would be glad if someone would trade me a Vanillish for my Throh...
Oho. You’ll trade with me?
Perhaps I’ll ask another Trainer...
Oho! Quite the splendid Vanillish, I say. You have my gratitude!
Oho! This Vanillish sure is a cute one! I want to stay with it forever!
Ah, sorry young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady, but if you want to trade, you’ll need to have at least two Pokémon in your party. Come back when you do, eh?

I’m lookin’ for a Pokémon trade. How ’bout your Obstagoon for my Kantonian Mr. Mime?
You sure you wanna trade that Obstagoon?
Right then. Come back whenever.
Thanks, mate! I’ll take really good care of your Obstagoon!
No matter whose Pokémon it is, a Pokémon can only been given a nickname once. My Mymo already has a nickname, so you’ll never be able to change it!
You don’t have enough Pokémon in your party for a Pokémon trade. You need at least two if you wanna trade...
Mymo

I’m searching for a Frosmoth. You wouldn’t happen to have one, would you? If you do, I’d like for you to trade it for my Duraludon, please!
Oh! You’ll really trade me that Frosmoth!
Please come back if you change your mind.
Thank you so much! It’s just as splendid as everyone said it would be! It really gets my creative juices going!
Your Frosmoth is really energetic! It has great potential as a design model!
You can’t trade when you’ve only got one party Pokémon. Come back when you’ve got some more Pokémon with you.

Welcome to the Dream Park! Where dreams become reality and Fossils become Pokémon!
Do you have any Fossils on you? Do you wanna turn ’em back into Pokémon?
[~ 2]
Which Fossil do you want to restore back into a Pokémon then?
All righty! You just leave it up to me! I’m gonna turn that [VAR ITEM2(0000)] of yours back into a Pokémon lickety-split!
What, you don’t want me to restore your Fossil? Tch! Don’t you get how amazing this chance is?
[~ 6]
I turned that Fossil of yours right back into the Pokémon it used to be! This here is [VAR PKNAME(0001)]! You’d better take right good care of it!
You obtained [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
[~ 9]
Hmm? Now color me surprised! Your team’s just packed with Pokémon! I guess I’ll just have to take care of this lovable little lug until you come back with some space!
Someday this whole place is going to be filled to bursting with Pokémon from the ancient past. That’s my dream for this: the Dream Park! To bring the ancient world back to life!

No, thanks
If you want to meet mysterious Pokémon that disappeared from the world long ago... Then you’ll have to find some Fossils first! You do know about Fossils, right?
If you find any Fossils, you can have my pa take a look at them for you.
Fossils are the remains of ancient Pokémon that have been preserved in the ground. They can be restored and brought back to life so we can meet those ancient Pokémon again! What do you think? It’s pretty amazing, right?
Wow! You’re pretty amazing yourself! You’ve found every known Fossil that can be restored into a living Pokémon, haven’t you? That is just so amazing that I think I will have to give you a little reward! This is your proof of being a Fossil Master!
Are you a Fossiphiliac, too? A Fossil fan, my fine [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl! If you are, you might know the answer to this... What did my sweet [VAR ITEM2(000A)] turn into when I had it restored? If you’d like to see for yourself, how about a Pokémon battle?
That’s a real shame! Don’t let that refusal fossilize—come back and fight me anytime!
That’s right! Sweet little [VAR ITEM2(000A)] becomes a fine [VAR PKNAME(000B)]!
I hope I’ll get to meet more sweet little Fossils soon, not just my [VAR ITEM2(000A)]!

Oh, I’ve gone ahead and tucked your hat into your Bag, since you can’t wear it with this look.
Would you like to put your hat back on or...?
I’ll wear it
Leave it off
Then on we go! I think it’ll look good with your hat on as well.
Then I’ll just tuck the hat you were wearing back into your Bag, darling.

Hello. Do you want to use this and awaken your Pokémon’s hidden powers?
Hidden Power changes type depending on the Pokémon that learns it. Somehow I can tell what type that move will be. If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn. Would you like to know this?
If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn. Would you like to know this?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move’s type would be [VAR TYPE(0000)].
The type of this Pokémon’s Hidden Power is [VAR TYPE(0000)]!
If you want to know, just ask me.
I don’t think it’s possible for an Egg to use Hidden Power.
Unfortunately, this Pokémon can’t learn to use Hidden Power.

[~ 1]
Route 1
Welcome to the town of Wedgehurst Our quiet borough is home to the esteemed Pokémon Research Lab.
Route 2
Trainer Tips Pokémon can gain Exp. Points by battling other Pokémon. Exp. Points help them grow stronger. And your Pokémon will still get Exp. Points even if you catch a Pokémon you are battling against!
Trainer Tips Trying to take another person’s Pokémon makes you no different than a thief! Poké Balls are only to be used to try to catch wild Pokémon that have no Trainers!
The Pokémon Nursery You’ve found the right place to come to for all your Pokémon Egg finding needs.
Welcome to the city of Motostoke An industrial city studded with steam-powered marvels of modern engineering.
Route 3
Trainer Tips You can set up camp on routes, and your Pokémon can earn Exp. Points from camping. Try visiting other people’s camps, too, when you find tents along your way.
[~ 11]
Galar Mine lies ahead
Route 4
Trainer Tips A Pokémon’s moves can be physical moves or special moves. A high Attack stat makes physical moves deal more damage, and a high Sp. Atk stat makes special moves deal more damage!
Welcome to the town of Turffield A town nestled within the nurturing bowl of our many terraced farming fields.
Welcome to the town of Turffield Renowned since days of yore for the stunning and historical geoglyph upon our hill!
Turffield Stadium
Route 5
The Pokémon Nursery You’ve found the right place to come to for all your Pokémon Egg finding needs.
[~ 20]
Trainer Tips Pokémon that appear to be surrounded by a brilliant aura tend to be stronger than others. And when you defeat them, they drop Watts! It seems you become more likely to spot these Brilliant Pokémon the more Pokémon you catch!
Welcome to the town of Hulbury A bustling seaport that many visit to see its lively market stalls and famed restaurant!
Hulbury Stadium
Motostoke Outskirts
Galar Mine No. 2 → ← Motostoke
Welcome to the ancient city of Hammerlocke A city of great history, living and thriving within castle walls that date back to the middle ages.
Route 6
Trainer Tips You can use each Technical Machine, or TM, as many times as you like on your Pokémon. Teach your Pokémon moves of various types to give them an advantage against all kinds of different opponents in battle! Technical Records, or TRs, can only be used one time before they break, however. Be more thoughtful when choosing to use them!
Welcome to the town of Stow-on-Side A vibrant town that has grown up around an ancient mural tucked away in the mountains.
↑ Ballonlea ↓ Stow-on-Side
Come see the famed sights of Stow-on-Side! Discover the history of the Galar region!

Stow-on-Side Stadium
Welcome to the town of Ballonlea A charming town where the people make their homes among the trunks of the towering trees.
Ballonlea Stadium
Route 7
Trainer Tips If you want to stop a Pokémon from evolving, press the B Button while it’s trying to evolve. The Pokémon will be startled and stop evolving. This trick is called an Evolution cancel!
Welcome to the town of Circhester Buildings from an age long gone still stand about the steaming hot spring that covers the town.
Trainer Tips The Pokémon species you see recommended in your Pokédex will be updated once you manage to catch them all or when the date changes.
Circhester Stadium
Route 8
Trainer Tips Checking out glowing Pokémon Dens in the Wild Area will help you store up Watts! If you climbed all the way up here, you’re likely the sort to investigate every nook and cranny. So keep that curiosity alive to search out every last den as you run around the Wild Area, too!
Welcome to the town of Spikemuth This rocking town has a punk vibe and streets crammed with shops lined up cheek by jowl.
Route 9
↑ Route 9 → Spikemuth
Circhester Bay
↓ Spikemuth
Trainer Tips There are times when you throw a Poké Ball to catch a Pokémon, and it shakes just once. The more Pokémon you catch, the more likely this curious phenomenon is to occur. Since it makes it more likely you’ll be able to catch your target, it’s called a critical catch.
Route 10
Trainer Tips The Dynamax phenomenon is caused by a special power that originates from within Pokémon, warping the space around them and making them appear far larger than they truly are. Some Pokémon also change appearance upon Dynamaxing. This particular kind of Dynamaxing is also known as Gigantamaxing.
Welcome to the modern city of Wyndon This booming metropolis was designed and developed by our very own Chairman Rose.
Flying lost in Wyndon’s winding streets? Use the city’s dedicated Flying Taxis or the monorail!

Hello, hello![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh! That your flash new phone, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Were you watching Lee’s exhibition match on it? But you can’t cheer him on with your hands full! You know the only way to properly cheer on Lee would be with his famous Charizard pose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop! Didn’t expect to see you here today, dear. Isn’t this the big day?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, that’s exactly why I came running over to get [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Never mind watching the match now! I’ve got it recording at home anyway. I record all my brother’s matches.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! He should be here any minute! And Lee always brings presents when he visits, so I wouldn’t forget that Bag if I were you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now I’ve got to run! See you at mine later![VAR 0114(0005)]
What is it, love? Isn’t Hop expecting you?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Rushing off in that state, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Didn’t Hop say you should bring your Bag? I last saw it in your room. And don’t forget to grab a hat for the weather![VAR 0114(0008)]
You grabbed your dad’s old Bag!
You grabbed your mum’s old Bag!
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
Oh, don’t you look a treat! I knew that Bag would suit you. Now hurry along. Hop is waiting, isn’t he? But remember—no going into the forest for the two of you![VAR 0114(0008)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text File : 96

Hahaha! Have a look at you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! That old Bag looks like it could pull you over! At least we know that it should hold anything Lee might bring, even if it’s as big as a Snorlax![VAR 0114(0005)]
A Wooloo... But what’s it doing there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! You silly Wooloo! I see what you’re up to! Don’t go using Tackle on the fencing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, you listen! No going past that fence! No! Everyone knows there are scary Pokémon living in the Slumbering Weald![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meeeh?
Now that that’s taken care of... How about it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Let’s race! Bet I can make it to my house first, what with you lugging about that big old Bag![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, and you’ve brought along [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Hello, dear.
Oh, and you’ve brought along [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Hello, dear.
Yeah, yeah, but where’s Lee? Have you got him crammed in a cupboard?[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s still not here yet! For the hundredth time... Honestly, Hop, you must learn some patience!
He’s probably only just arrived at the station in Wedgehurst.
Then that’s where I’m going! You know Lee is hopeless with directions. I’ll make sure he doesn’t get lost on the way![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, will you? Yes, that probably is for the best...
You’ve got to come with, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You’ve still never met my big bro, right? You can’t miss out on your chance to meet the undefeated Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll wait for you out on the route![VAR 0114(0005)]
Go on with Hop to pick up Leon, won’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I know you’re the reliable sort.
Go on with Hop to pick up Leon, won’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I know you’re the reliable sort.

Let’s get a move on![VAR 0114(0005)]
Only remember, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Wild Pokémon could come out of nowhere if you walk through patches of tall grass.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got my Wooloo with me, so I’m ready for battles against wild Pokémon, of course.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But not you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! So we’ll steer clear of the tall grass as we go.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hello, hello, Wedgehurst! Your Champion, Leon, is back! I promise I’ll keep doing my best to deliver the greatest battles for you all to watch![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s our unbeatable Champion! Leon, you and Charizard are the greatest!
Well, thank you for that! I hope you’ll all carry on training up your Pokémon and never shy from battle. Then come challenge me for the Champion title![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re on it! We’ve all been working on our battle skills just like you’ve taught us to, Lee!
But that Charizard of yours is too strong for the likes of us to take on!
Too true that Charizard is blazingly strong. But other Pokémon can be strong as well! That’s why I want the strongest of challengers to fill the Gym Challenge and come battle me![VAR 0114(0004)]
My wish is for Galar’s Trainers to work together to become the strongest in all the world![VAR 0114(0004)]
Graaawrrr!
Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, my number-one fan in all the world has come out of his way to pick me up![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look at you, Hop! I reckon you’ve grown...exactly an inch and a quarter since the last time I saw you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Bingo! That’s the sort of sharp eye that’s kept you undefeated so long, eh, Lee?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And these bright eyes over here... I’ve got it! You must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]—am I right? I’ve heard loads about you from my little brother.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the Galar region’s greatest-ever Pokémon Champion—and a massive Charizard fan, too. People call me the unbeatable Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, Lee! And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Bet I can beat the both of you back home![VAR 0114(0005)]
That Hop... Always wanting to be the best, isn’t he? With a proper rival of his own, I bet he’d push himself to become something truly special...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, everyone! I bid you farewell for today! But don’t you fret... I’ll always be around to make sure everyone in Galar can have a champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

Right then! The greatest gift from the greatest Champion... It’s show time, everyone![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Grass-type Pokémon... Grookey![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Fire-type Pokémon... Scorbunny![VAR 0114(0004)]

Where are you going, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?! You haven’t chosen a Pokémon yet![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! My dream is to help make the Trainers of the Galar region strong as they can be. Choose a partner for yourself and become one of those strong Trainers, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Scorbunny is Fire type. It’s filled to bursting with fiery passion![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s the Water-type Sobble. It adapts to anything, as surely as water flows.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, eh? It’s soothing—like a nice, long walk in the woods.[VAR 0114(0004)]

You’re set on the Fire-type Pokémon Scorbunny?
Going with the Water-type Pokémon Sobble?
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, is it?
It’s natural to want to consider your options! Though going with your instincts is fine, as well! You choose your dear partner however you like![VAR 0114(0004)]
You chose [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!

I bet you will be, Hop. That’s why I brought along these Pokémon for you and [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. So the two of you can battle and train and grow stronger together...to try to reach me![VAR 0114(0004)]

The next day...
You spent the whole night with that new partner of yours, right, Hop? You two getting on all right? Understanding one another? Maybe even built up a bit of love?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Course I have, Lee! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s made fast friends with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then listen up, new Trainers! Believe in yourself and your Pokémon! If you trust in one another and carry on battling side by side long enough, then someday...[VAR 0114(0004)]
you might even become worthy rivals for me, the unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
What’re you looking at h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer for, Lee?! I’m the one who’ll be coming to challenge you![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you think [VAR TRNAME(0000)] might be able to challenge you, then I guess [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s my first rival! But I’m not planning to lose to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer and miss out on my chance to beat the unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]

Just having a Pokémon with you doesn’t make you a real Trainer, you know. Proper Trainers raise their Pokémon up to be first-rate in battle, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and you think you’re worthy of calling yourself such a proper Trainer already, Hop? Guess I’ll be the judge of that! Let’s see how you handle yourself in a battle against your friend, if [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s up for it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you say? Willing and ready to take Hop on in the first-ever Pokémon battle of your life?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Then how about I give you a spot of advice. You don’t want to go getting so caught up in things that you forget everything you’ve accomplished till now. Take a moment to jot down what you’ve done, in order to save a record of your progress![VAR 0114(0004)]
Believe in your partner Pokémon! And care for them, too, with all your heart. Do those two things, and I’m certain you’ll learn to choose the moves that suit your Pokémon. And more importantly...to have a champion time battling with them![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like everyone’s on board, Pokémon and Trainers alike? Then let’s do this![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve watched every match that Lee’s ever had! I’ve read every book and magazine he left behind at home, too! I know exactly what to do in order to win![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that was a shock! Guess I know now why Lee thought he should give you a Pokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry, mate. Even if you did get your Pokémon direct from a champ like Lee, looks like I’m still the greatest![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your Pokémon all fought hard. Made me almost want to let out Charizard and join in on all the fun! Good effort out there, [VAR PKNAME(0001)]! Why don’t I get you all sorted?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’ve got real promise! In fact, I’ve got a favor to ask you... Be a real rival to Hop, would you? Push him, and make the both of you stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
Me and [VAR PKNAME(0002)] are ready to have a go at you anytime![VAR 0114(0005)]

I already want to get stronger and stronger! You’ve seen me battle now, Lee, so come on— you’ve gotta let me take on the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Pokémon Gyms[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You? Join the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR COLOR(0000)]? You think you’re ready for the single greatest competition in the Galar region? Not putting the cart before the Rapidash there, Little Brother?[VAR 0114(0004)]
If that’s really what you want to do, you two have a whole lot you need to learn about Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially your friend [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Before you think about getting Gym Badges, best to think about getting a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A Trainer’s Pokédex helps them learn lots of things about all the Pokémon out there, including their strengths. But it’s more than just a collection of data, you know. It’s a record of a Trainer’s love and passion for Pokémon training![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, right, we get it... Pokédexes, then! We’re on it! Looks like it’s off to the Pokémon Research Lab for you and me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the kind of enthusiasm a Trainer needs! I’ll let the professor know to expect you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m going to be the next Champion, so completing a simple Pokédex will be nothing! Just another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’d probably better go tell your mum that we’re heading out, though.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve found yourself a perfectly lovely partner, haven’t you? Congratulations, dear.

*CRASH*
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Did you hear that just now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The gate’s open! And the Wooloo that was there...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was tackling the fence pretty hard earlier. You don’t think it actually broke through there, do you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s off-limits! Nobody’s supposed to go in there! I remember the professor’s granddaughter went in once, and she came back in a real state... And that was nothing compared to the earful she got from the professor afterward![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... What do you say?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got to save it!
I don’t know...
Right? Even if we’re not supposed to, this is the kind of scene where you simply have to do what’s needed![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right... No one wants to get in trouble, least of all me. But deep down you want to save that Pokémon, too, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hope you’re ready for anything, because we’re going in, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Doing all right there, [VAR PKNAME(0001)]? Let’s be sure you’re in tip-top shape.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Not trying to ditch me in here, are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Wha—? Lee? How’d you manage to find your way here? You’re pants with directions. You always get lost.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s nice to hear from the little brother who had me worried sick! I’d been waiting ages for you two, and you never showed! Of course I came looking for the both of you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, where’s the Wooloo?! We were trying to rescue that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meh!
The little chap’s just fine. Though all of you had fainted by the time I found you here. You know this place is out of bounds... But it took courage to come in here all the same. And I can understand well enough why you did it. You did good, Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
And at least that Wooloo’s all right... Yeah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I thought we’d had it when that weird fog started rolling in and that mad Pokémon attacked... but at least it wasn’t all for nothing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Attacked by some mad Pokémon? What are you talking about, Hop?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It seemed loads stronger than any Pokémon I’ve ever seen. And it just had this sort of presence... Our moves didn’t even touch it. I mean, really— they seemed to pass right through it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your moves passed right through it? So, the fearsome Pokémon they say live in the Slumbering Weald... Are they actually illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Get strong enough and maybe the two of you could be the ones to reveal the truth someday.[VAR 0114(0004)]
For now, let’s simply get out of this place. You’ll be all right now that I’m here with you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even if we did get an earful from Lee...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Bow wark!
What is it today, Leon? Looking for info on another never-before-seen, superstrong Pokémon? I wish you’d stop with these outlandish requests.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Good to see you, too, Yamper![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yamper here is a real champ when it comes to helping you find your way around. He came to my rescue plenty of times back in the day, when I got lost on the road. Oh yeah, and that’s his Trainer, Sonia. What can I say about Sonia? Well, I like the way she cooks. She makes food you can gobble down in a flash.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Tsk. What kind of an introduction is that? Did you forget we were rivals during our Gym Challenge? It wasn’t just Yamper helping you out. I did, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, nice to meet you! Name’s Sonia. I’m the professor’s assistant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s a new Pokémon Trainer. Set h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer on the right path, would you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
*sigh* What does he think I am? He’s always got his head in the clouds. It’s no wonder he gets lost all the time.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh. Looks like you’ve got a Rotom Phone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey there, Rotom![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bzzzrt!
Rotom Phones are handy little things, aren’t they? They’ve got a map and a navigation tool. That said, Leon still gets lost, so...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, sorry. So tell me, do you know a lot about Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You bet!
Not really...
Well said! In that case, I’ll make it so that you can use the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
Don’t worry! Here, I’ll make it so that you can use the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
You obtained the [VAR COLOR(0008)]Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Just so you know, that Pokédex is a gift from my gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
Could you let Gran know that you received the Pokédex? She lives in the house down along Route 2.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Leon’s a right amazing Champion, and I’m basically just an assistant... I’m not even Gran’s official assistant, either. I’ve just been calling myself one... Somehow, it makes me feel a little restless.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hey there, Trainer! Sorry to stop you.
You just left the Pokémon Lab, right? So that means you’ve got a Pokédex, yeah? I love talking to new Trainers and giving them useful stuff.
It’s a Potion. Use it when your Pokémon’s HP— their hit points—gets low. HP is like a Pokémon’s stamina. You can even use Potions during battle.
Knowledge is power! It’s a good idea to talk to lots of different people and read everything you can on your journey!

Got your Pokédex from Sonia? Then it’s time to meet lots of different Pokémon and start building up a strong team![VAR 0114(0005)]
But battling strong Pokémon in the wild can leave your team in a bad way. Not to mention what battling another Trainer can do... Luckily, we’ve got Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Luckier yet, they’re dead easy to spot. They look the same wherever you go.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Bet you’ve never been inside one![VAR 0114(0005)]

Level with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Is this your first time in a Pokémon Center?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...
Of course not
Then I don’t think you need me to tell you what you already know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then the future Champion’s got you covered![VAR 0114(0005)]
First things first—you talk to the lady at the counter if you want your Pokémon healed up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And Pokémon you catch are kept in computers like the one you can find here, see? After all, you can only bring six Pokémon with you on the road in your party.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Potions they sell at the Poké Mart got me out of a real rough spot the other day!
If you two kids are Pokémon Trainers, you might want to buy some Potions before you head out!
Cheers! I’m already good, though. I’m heading to Route 2, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Come find me, maybe, when you’re done here![VAR 0114(0005)]

Listen, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I’ve been thinking... If you’re a Pokémon Trainer now, you must want to try your hand at the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR COLOR(0000)], right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge?
What’s that?
The Gym Challenge, mate! The annual competition where Trainers can battle it out for the right to challenge the Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
But the trick is that you’ve got to be endorsed if you want to take part. And Lee doesn’t seem to think I’m up to snuff... So I’m thinking I ought to talk to the professor and see if she could help![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to take part, too! A proper rival is just the thing every Trainer needs to keep growing stronger, after all. Keeps you motivated, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor’s house is way down at the end of Route 2, so let’s head there...and give our teams the chance to train up a bit along the way![VAR 0114(0005)]

Over here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? It’s time we filled in our teams a bit—[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m here to teach you how! You’ll need to catch Pokémon if you’ve got any hope of filling in that Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee?! Where’d you come from?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Only...look at you, little [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ve already caught some on your own! Your mum gave you those Poké Balls, did she?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Every Pokémon has got a type or two, which can make it good against some opponents but poor against others. That’s the reason you’ll want to catch different Pokémon—to cover one another’s weaknesses. Now, let’s all have a champion time as I show you how it’s done![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
[~ 8]
Typical Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll give you some more Poké Balls. In return, I’ll only ask that you catch plenty of Pokémon! The Pokémon around here seem easy to catch. Almost like they’re itching to join some Trainer’s team, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Pokémon on your team will get Exp. Points when you catch Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course, they get Exp. Points from battle, so take on the other Trainers you meet along the path to help your Pokémon thrive. Your team will keep on changing and growing as you get stronger together, no doubt... But even I don’t know exactly how yet! Show your Champion something good, all right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! I’m gonna catch loads of Pokémon. The professor will be shocked when she sees![VAR 0114(0005)]

Look! There’s the professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
So have you unraveled all the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon yet?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh goodness, no. The whole thing is still full of questions. I’d hoped that my granddaughter would take over my research, but...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Dear me, I’m sorry. I didn’t even notice my guests![VAR 0114(0042)]

Why, Hop dear. I see Wooloo has made some new friends.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And you must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I trust you received the Pokédex from Sonia. I’m sure you’ll have it complete in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
You must already know about Dynamaxing, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor Magnolia’s been doing research into the Dynamax phenomenon for years and years. And it takes a proper understanding of the thing if you plan to use Dynamaxing to the fullest![VAR 0114(0004)]
There you go again, Leon, always talking about Pokémon. There are other things that are worth knowing about, too, you know. Like how many different types of tea there are![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hey, Professor, do us a favor, would you? Help me convince Lee he should endorse us for the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh Leon, why wouldn’t you endorse them?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop and [VAR TRNAME(0000)] only just started out as Pokémon Trainers... There’s still loads they don’t know yet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Dearie, I thought your dream was to have everyone in the Galar region become strong Trainers. Isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, yeah...you’re not wrong. That goal’s precisely the reason I gave them both Pokémon, in fact.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, then. In that case...how about this? Let’s see if the two of you can show me such a brilliant battle that I’m left with no choice but to endorse you. And don’t worry. I’ll make sure both your teams are in good shape before the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right! I’ll be waiting outside, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now remember, be sure to give it everything you’ve got. That’s the best thing you can do for your Pokémon—and for yourself, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I’m going to become the greatest Pokémon Trainer there is! And to do that, I need that endorsement to take part in the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come at me with everything you have so we can prove to Lee that we’ve got what it takes![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
I’m rather interested in seeing how you two young Trainers battle, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Listen, you two. The reason I’m unbeatable is because I learn from every battle I see or take part in. That’s how I’ve gotten to where I am today. So show me something good in this battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll be sure to. Ready for this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Time for a serious match between you and me... to fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
I need to prepare...
It’s time for my legend to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, fine... Guess I can wait a bit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hurry it up, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ve gotta battle me so I can get myself that endorsement![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember what I asked you, don’t you? I think you’ve got potential, and that’s why I want you to be a real rival to Hop. And that’s direct from your Champion Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]

Hah! See that! I knew I could do it. Am I ever glad I could beat you this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Undefeated! And my Pokémon’s moves were seriously on point![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sting of defeat and the joy of victory... I guess going through both is the key to the two of us getting stronger, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 161

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hop! Well, after seeing a match like that one... I suppose I’ve little choice but to give you both an endorsement as Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yes! Thanks, Lee! I swear I’m going to win my way through the Gym Challenge to reach you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You may both be young still, and plenty rough around the edges, but it was a proper battle. Charizard and I were both feeling the excitement in every last cell in our bodies![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hop, you’ve always tended to get caught up in things like how you throw your Poké Ball out... Things that have nothing to do with real strength. Honestly, I’d been worried about you still obsessing over that sort of nonsense, but it seems you really have grown a bit, Little Brother![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I’d like to see some more thrilling Pokémon battles out of you, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You and me are going to train up against one another to aim for that Champion’s title![VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Against one another?
The more we keep battling against one another, the more our Pokémon will grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the way of it when you’ve got a great rival! Just like you’ve got me, and I’ve got you![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Huh? What’s that?![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Would you look at this? They’re Wishing Stars! Since there are two of them, you should take one yourself![VAR 0114(0005)]
With one of these, my Pokémon can Dynamax! They’re gonna be massive! YES![VAR 0114(0005)]
Trust you to pull something like this! They say Wishing Stars fall down for those who have a true wish in their heart, you know.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I will be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL BE THE GREATEST TRAINER EVER!!! There! I’ve said it three times, so surely my wish will come true now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t be silly, Hop. Those Wishing Stars are composed of a curious sort of rock containing unknown power... They are one of the most precious resources we have here in the Galar region. But they won’t do a thing for you in that state. Give them to me now, and I’ll have you sorted.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, right. You’ve done heaps of research on the Dynamax phenomenon, haven’t you, Professor? Then please! Give [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and me the power to Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
First we got to battle against that mad Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald, and now this... It really feels like we’re getting caught up in the adventure of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand your excitement, young man, but don’t get carried away. You want to save your energy for tomorrow’s journey![VAR 0114(000A)]
Seems I came back home right in time for all the excitement![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, you lot, why not have some dinner. You must be hungry, right? I’ve been totally obsessed with making the latest trendy curries.[VAR 0114(000B)]

It’s morning at last! And time for our adventure to truly start![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good morning to you, young Challengers.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop, is it true you really met some Pokémon you didn’t recognize? Is there anything more you can tell me about it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, well, there was weird heavy fog, and then this even weirder Pokémon appeared... [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)] tried to fight it off! But then I think we both passed out or something. It’s all pretty hazy.[VAR 0114(0005)]
A right fount of information you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], Hop, these are for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got a Dynamax Band from Professor Magnolia and slipped it on your wrist!
Those are your Dynamax Bands. I made them by fitting the Wishing Stars you found last night into those bands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thanks, Professor! This is brilliant! It’s just like the one Lee has on him, too. Now we can Dynamax our Pokémon like he does![VAR 0114(0005)]
My word, you don’t waste any time, do you? I think you’ll find it’s not so simple as all that. There are a number of conditions you must meet if you hope to have your Pokémon Dynamax and take on that gigantic form.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, don’t be afraid to go to all sorts of places and meet all sorts of Pokémon. That will help fill out your Pokédex, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legend of my reign is finally about to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ll beat you to the station![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 13]

You will have the chance to meet many Pokémon and Trainers in the Wild Area. You may even encounter Dynamax Pokémon in such places. Put your faith in your partner, and push yourself to new heights together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
A strange Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald... I don’t know... I’ve got an uneasy feeling for some reason...[VAR 0114(000B)]

One last thing before we race, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. See, I’ve got some great advice for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know how you sometimes see Pokémon wandering about out of the tall grass, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you move real slow like, and crouch down, those Pokémon won’t pay you any notice.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But on the other hand... If you whistle at them, you’ll be SURE to catch their attention![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re a bit rubbish at whistling, just remember this: “Need a fail-proof trick? Press the Left Stick!”[VAR 0114(0005)]
Try it out, and let’s see who can catch the most Pokémon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember Wedgehurst Station, right? Where we went to pick up Lee before. That’ll be the goal, so see you there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ll never beat me to the station at that pace![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, out with it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! How many did you catch? I caught a really special one![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got... Not one?! What were you doing this whole time? You’re going to want a team if you’re a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got yourself... Ooh, just one! Looks like we’re at a draw. Though we are rivals and all, so that’s fair![VAR 0114(0005)]
But look at how many you caught! You’re well on your way to building a fine team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s a technical machine! A TM, mate! With a TM like that, you can teach your Pokémon a new move in a flash. And you can use them again and again, too. That one can teach the move Swift. Lee gave it to me ages ago, and now it’s yours.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge will begin in Motostoke! And our train’s waiting, so let’s go![VAR 0114(0005)]

Not quite so fast, you two.[VAR 0114(0009)]
What’re you doing here, Mum?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew this day was coming since the moment you chose [VAR PKNAME(0001)] as a partner, darling.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Professor Magnolia was kind enough to let us know that you two were setting out. So here—a last little gift to see you well set on your way. All the kit you’ll need for camping![VAR 0114(0008)]
No matter what happens out there, if you and your partner are together, I know you’ll be fine.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks, Mum. And just think how lucky you are— mother to the first ever pair of Champion brothers! Because I’m certain to be the Champion next. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course you will be, darling. Anyway, do have fun and take care of yourselves! You’ll be welcome back home anytime![VAR 0114(0009)]
We’re off!
We’ll be fine!
Wish us luck! Not that we’ll need it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are loads of brilliant Trainers and all kinds of Pokémon out there waiting for us![VAR 0114(0005)]
My excitement’s running ahead of me even faster than that train can go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Come on! We’re off![VAR 0114(0005)]
I imagine those two will be facing quite the surprise when they arrive in Motostoke.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But who can blame them? A train journey does always set the imagination on fire.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Hey, Mr. Station Master! Isn’t this the Wild Area? What’re we stopped here for?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes... This is the Wild Area Station, make no mistake. I’m sorry to tell you that the train is halted, due to a flock of Wooloo on the tracks.
What’s there to be sorry about? This is brilliant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Brilliant?
What is?
This Wild Area is massive! There are loads of Pokémon to battle here! You get it, don’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? This is the best possible place to put together the greatest team![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can get you back to Wedgehurst, if you like. But Motostoke is off the menu for now. It wouldn’t be very decent of us to try to drive off those Pokémon just because we happen to want to run our train here, now would it?

That’s Motostoke, way off that way![VAR 0114(0005)]
And between there and here are countless new Pokémon waiting to be met![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hello. And if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]
My gran gave me a proper earful, in her own way... “Those two young Trainers are setting out on a journey, but what are you doing with your life?”[VAR 0114(000B)]
That sounds rough
Ouch, Professor...
Ah... Never you mind that! Nothing to worry yourselves over! Besides, I’d been quite curious about that Pokémon you two met in the forest. I’d been thinking I should look into it, so the timing works out fine![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I discover something really huge, then maybe even Gran’ll admit I’ve got some talent![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yikes... Being an adult has got its own challenges, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I said you needn’t worry about it! I’m glad to be on the road. Really! It’s been ages. It’ll be great fun to fish and camp and rough it outside again.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]

Well, I’m off to go stick my head in as many of those red glowing dens as I can find. I’m going to battle the snot out of a bunch of Dynamax Pokémon and fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
What cheek! Dynamax Pokémon are really on another level, you know! You’d better Dynamax your partner Pokémon, too, if you want to take on opponents that strong![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll find spots here and there in the Wild Area that emit a red beam of light. If you think you’re up to it, check them out. There’ll be Dynamax Pokémon lurking inside! So with that, how about I send you off with a little treat from me?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With a Pokémon Box Link, you’ll be able to put Pokémon from your team into your Boxes or take Pokémon from your Boxes to add them to your team. Nice, right? So go wild catching as many Pokémon as you like, and fill in some more of your Pokédex![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Wild Area is waiting for you! This is the start of your real adventure![VAR 0114(000B)]

Real ace of you to make it through the Wild Area! Seems like your trek ran your Pokémon ragged, though. You should pop into the Pokémon Center.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Rotomi are a kind of Rotom Information service. It’s a handy machine for Trainers. You can even use one to customize your League Card![VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t you try playing around with your League Card a bit, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Here’s a sample for you![VAR 0114(000B)]

But Motostoke sure is big, right? Not to worry! Sonia is here to show you around a bit! Come find me after you heal up your Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
The opening ceremony, huh... I get a bit worked up when I think how exciting and moving it was to actually stand on a stadium’s pitch for the first time![VAR 0114(000B)]

Uhhh...
Yup! The Gym Challenge opening ceremony.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What? You seriously forgot about the Gym Challenge opening ceremony?[VAR 0114(000B)]
By the way, the ceremony tomorrow is being held at the Motostoke Stadium, OK?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Use that lift over there to get to the stadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, laters! I’m going to swing by the shops while I’m here, but don’t forget to register at the stadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! All right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
One look tells me that you’ve become a Trainer worthy of that endorsement I gave you! And...yes, I reckon you might even be ready to use this... Here, try giving this to your partner to hold![VAR 0114(0004)]
You heading for Motostoke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I am!
I’ve got other plans first
You can take that lift up to the city’s upper level, if you’re headed for the stadium next.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you might want to have a look around the city first. Only don’t get lost like I do! When you’re ready to visit the stadium, take the lift to get up there![VAR 0114(0004)]

Motostoke Stadium... This is where the opening ceremony will be held.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Everyone’ll be watching the opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge... My mum... Your mum... The whole world![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s getting me a bit nervous, really... Naw, this isn’t nerves... I’m only trembling because I’m so excited![VAR 0114(0005)]

Would you take a look at this... The place is packed with Gym Challengers! Every one of these folks is another rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously? What a piece of work...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s get signed up![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re here to register for the Gym Challenge, I’ll need to see your endorsement, please.
Fancy that... This is the first time we’ve had a challenger endorsed by the Champion!
Well, now you’ve had two, because I am as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! Two of you at once?! I wonder what’s come over Leon this year... The two of you must be something special.
I’m Hop! I’m Leon’s little brother, in fact. And the next Champion. Get me all signed up, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
W-well, yes, I am trying to... If you’ll just give me a moment...
There! You two have been successfully registered as Gym Challengers. You can now choose your preferred number for your uniform, if you’d be so kind? It will be displayed on the back of the uniform you must wear for any official match.
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], is it? Very well. And here. Please wear this Challenge Band at all times to identify yourself as a Gym Challenger.
The opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge is to be held here tomorrow. All the Trainers taking part have been booked a room at the nearby Budew Drop Inn.
That’s the League Chairman for you! Even booked us all hotel rooms! I’m off to check out the fancy digs![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re lookin’ a bit gobsmacked by all this. You must be from some small country town, is that it? I’m quite the same myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I was endorsed by the chairman himself. In other words, among all those elite enough to get an endorsement, I’m the most elite of all. So why don’t you clear off and not try talking to me again, would you? It’s positively criminal of you, wasting the time of someone as important as I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
If you’re looking for the Budew Drop Inn, you’ll find it’s not far from the stadium. Head toward Route 3—it’s along the way.

Hiya! Looks like you both got yourselves registered.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh hey, Sonia! What’re you doing at our hotel?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m researching the mysterious Pokémon that are said to be in the Slumbering Weald. I reckon if I look into some of Galar’s legends, I might figure something out. Care to join me? You’re here already anyway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s this, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a statue of the hero who once saved the Galar region. I could run through the legend right quick, if you fancy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The short version, if you please!
Give me all the details!
Long ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. People called it “the Darkest Day.” The land was assaulted by gigantic Pokémon... but they were defeated by a single young hero bearing a sword and shield. This statue here is meant to depict the young hero of that legend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We still don’t understand what kind of sword and shield the hero actually had. And what this “black storm” is supposed to be is just another mystery... Whatever it was, it blotted out the skies all across Galar. I suppose that tracks with it being called the Darkest Day, but still...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh... I suppose that hero must’ve been about as strong as Lee, then! Looks like you’re going to have your hands full with plenty to research, though, Sonia. Black storms and swords and shields and all...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be all right, Sonia!
Will you be all right, Sonia?
Heh, thanks! I’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
Course I will. I’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
You two are staying here at the hotel tonight, though, aren’t you? Shouldn’t you check in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Probably so! And we’ll look out for you, too, Sonia. If we hear anything about any hero or whatnot, we’ll tell you![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess we probably should head to the front desk to get checked in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks for always taggin’ along with Hop. I hope you can keep it up. Leon really worries about him, too. He practically raised him, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]

We came all the way out to this big city so that we could properly cheer on Gym Challengers! Team Yell is here to help, after all! You’re in for a battle if you wanna stop us!
I’m up for that!
Sorry to bother you
Didn’t we tell you, mate? You get in our way, and you’re in for a battle! Team Yell’s all about helpin’... Helpin’ one very special Trainer win the Gym Challenge, that is! We wanna make sure she gets cheered on nice and proper... And now you’re gonna help us make some noise![VAR 0114(006F)]
Oi, gimme a break here! Team Yell! Get revenge for me, wouldja?[VAR 0114(006F)]
Course I’ve got you covered, mate! What could be better than a battle in a lovely hotel lobby?[VAR 0114(006F)]
Ah man! The swanky, sophisticated air in here had me off my game! I couldn’t keep my cool![VAR 0114(006F)]
I wasn’t expecting checking in would be such a big fuss, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! What’s going on? Sneaking in some Pokémon battles without me?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t think you can get ahead of me that easily... I need to get some training in, so I’m joining! Here, I’ll even heal up your Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m Hop, one of this year’s Gym Challengers! And the one who’s gonna be the next Champion! Now let’s have us a nice two-on-two![VAR 0114(0005)]
I can already hear my victory comin’! The only sound you’ll make is a whimper of defeat![VAR 0114(006F)]
Guess it was defeat that I heard comin’... I think I’m about to cry...[VAR 0114(006F)]
What are you lot doin’ here?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Marnie?![VAR 0114(006F)]
N-n-nothin’... We was just...[VAR 0114(006F)]
I know you all are terribly curious ’bout the other Gym Challengers, but you gotta show a bit of restraint.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sorry ’bout them! They’re just a bunch of my fans. Call themselves Team Yell and follow me around, cheerin’ for me. I think they’ve let it all go to their heads a bit...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come on, you lot! Back home with you now![VAR 0114(000D)]
They’re just so caught up with wantin’ to support me and all that they tend to get a bit shirty with other Gym Challengers. Sorry if they caused you any trouble.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So you’re a Gym Challenger, too? Team Yell, was it? Pretty impressive that you already have a set of fans to call your own![VAR 0114(0005)]

Yes, young M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... I see that the League has booked a room for you.
Oh look. And you have a sense of humor, too. Yes, young M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... I see that the League has booked a room for you.
And if I might, thank you for helping us out of a sticky situation with those hooligans earlier. I hope you have a pleasant stay here with us. Sleep well.
This season is always the busiest, what with all the Gym Challengers and the tourists they draw.

Of course. You should have no problem making your own way through to the Gym Stadium, right?

Wonderful! You look sharp as a pin. And that [VAR 01C4(0001)] there... That really is the number for you!
Now we’re ready at last for the opening ceremony for this year’s Gym Challenge!

[~ 1]
[~ 2]
You’ve made it at last, Hop. And you, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
So you’re the two Trainers our Champion endorsed himself! Welcome, and it’s a delight to meet you! I’m Rose, of course.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, and what’s this?! I see you both already possess Dynamax Bands! How wonderful! It seems you two have been led here by the guiding light of the Wishing Stars. By the way, it was my wonderful company that invented those Dynamax Bands, you know![VAR 0114(0006)]
I daresay this year’s Gym Challenge is looking to be an absolute blast! Very good—very good indeed! That means the whole Galar region is in for some excitement![VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 7]

The Gym Challenge is an excellent opportunity to show off your Dynamax Pokémon! Now, I’m terribly sorry, but there is some urgent business I need to attend to, so I must be on my way. The best of luck to both of you![VAR 0114(0006)]
The chairman certainly seems to be in high spirits! Now, listen closely, you two. You’ve both only just started on your path as Trainers. If you want to win, you need to do more than just train your Pokémon. You need to train yourselves, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s do it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You know the Gym Challenge has a set order that you’ve gotta visit the Gyms in, right? The first is in Turffield! And to get there, we need to head to Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)], the chairman asked me to deliver this gift to you.
A gift...such a wonderful thing... From the chairman...such a wonderful man...
*ahem* Excuse me. The gift is access to the Flying Taxis!
They allow you to, in a word, [VAR COLOR(0001)]Fly[VAR COLOR(0000)]! Calling a Flying Taxi will allow you to travel quickly back to areas you’ve already visited!
If it’s all right with you, I’ll read a segment from the Flying Taxi user’s manual. *ahem* “Press the X Button and select the Town Map option to choose the place you’d like to go to.”
Anyway, your next goal should be Turffield—isn’t that right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? When traveling to a new place, it’s best to get there on your own two legs, don’t you think?

All right!
But why?
I knew you’d be up for it! We’ve got to stay keener than anyone else if we want to steal the spotlight from our rivals![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously? This is the moment when you play along and act pumped up for battle! If you’ve gotta ask why we should bother training, you’ll never make it through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just what I’d expect from my rival! You know what? I’ll even give you one of my League Cards! That’s how good I think you did in that battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Our Gym Challenge starts right now—from here in Motostoke! Although the first Gym Leader we’ll have to challenge is in a town way far off from here... Still, you’d better believe I’m going to keep on winning my way to that Championship Match![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heya, Gym Challenger! You looked real ace out there during the opening ceremony![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, but where’s Hop?[VAR 0114(000B)]
He went on ahead
He went a different way
He can’t sit still at all, can he? Guess he really wants to catch up to his brother.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you’re rivals, after all. I guess it makes sense you’d train on your own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, I know! Let me tell you about something a bit interesting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You see that building over there? It’s a company owned by Chairman Rose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Just past Route 3, there’s a mine where they dig up ore. That building over there processes it into energy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In other words, the chairman is responsible for providing the Galar region with its energy, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t say I really get him, but the chairman seems like a pretty brilliant guy, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here, a little something for having a chin-wag with me! It’s an Escape Rope.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
The way to Turffield is pretty long, but that’s a kind of challenge in its own right. Good luck, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]

Coming this way? I’d advise against it. Any Trainer with a Wishing Star is in for a beating from me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0042)]
You. You’re the Gym Challenger endorsed by the Champion, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
What a joke. You are aware that the chairman is more important than the Champion, right? I was chosen by the chairman himself, so that makes me more amazing than you![VAR 0114(0042)]
I suppose I should prove beyond doubt just how pathetic you are and how strong I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, that was unexpected. I suppose you’re more able than I thought.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally, I’ll remember your battle style and strategies now. I’m sure to easily defeat you if and when we face each other in an official match.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that we’ve established that, I won’t waste any more time on you. I’ve already gathered every Wishing Star in this area.

Hmmm? Oh, you must be one of those Gym Challengers, right?
Yes, indeed!
No, I’m not
Ahhh, I thought so. I saw you at the opening ceremony.
Oh please, are you trying to have me on? I saw you at the opening ceremony!
My name’s Milo. I’m a Gym Leader and rather partial to Grass-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve been itching to see just how good the Champion-endorsed Gym Challengers are... Let me find out at the Gym Stadium! Just head on through this route, and you’ll run right into my stadium. See you there![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oh... But Sonia was looking for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. She wanted to ask you about something. She tried asking me, but I had no idea. She’s up on that what’s-her-face hill. You know the one.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger! Allow me to help you through your registration.
First things first—how about a quick refresher about the Gym Challenge? Your goal as a Gym Challenger is to complete each Gym mission, defeat every Gym Leader, and gather eight Gym Badges!
Got it!
Gym missions?
So, would you like to attempt the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!
One moment...
The [VAR COLOR(0001)]Gym mission[VAR COLOR(0000)] is a sort of test you need to go through before facing the Gym Leader. Each Gym has a different mission for challengers.
If you would like to attempt the Gym mission, please change into your uniform!
Then let the Gym mission begin! Give it your best shot!
You’re here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite words is perseverance!
Congratulations! You’ve completed the Gym mission! Don’t get too confident, though. Your teamwork with your Pokémon is key when battling the Gym Leader!
Oh, of course! Please come back anytime once you’re ready to attempt the mission!

The mission given by Turffield’s Pokémon Gym is this!
To chase our unruly Wooloo!
To that blockade we’ve made from our bales of straw over there!
Oh, by the way, you can call me Dan. I serve as a referee, and it’s also my job to report the results of battles to the League HQ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Then on with you! And good luck!
Chase after the Wooloo, and gather them by the blockade made of straw bales! If you do, they’ll break through the blockade, and you’ll be able to carry on ahead.
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Now you must face the Gym Leader, Milo, in a Pokémon battle!
I hope you’ll remember your battle with Milo every time you look at that Grass Badge!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
You’ve cleared the first blockade!
You’ve cleared the second blockade! Two more to go—you’re halfway there!
Would you look at that! Defeating the Trainers seems to have settled that Yamper down, too!
Brilliant! You’ve made it through three blockades! Just one last obstacle remains!

My Gym’s the first one people face, so we get a lot of challengers. That’s why I try to keep the Gym mission challenging, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
that didn’t stop you from completing it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Proper job![VAR 0114(000E)]
Sure seems like you understand Pokémon real well. This is gonna be a doozy of a battle! I’ll have to [VAR COLOR(0001)]Dynamax[VAR COLOR(0000)] my Pokémon if I want to win![VAR 0114(000E)]
That must have been a fulfilling Pokémon battle for you![VAR 0114(000E)]
As proof that you have defeated a Gym Leader for the Gym Challenge, allow me to present you with your very own Grass Badge![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 25!
You need to obtain all eight Gym Badges in order to complete the Gym Challenge. And the only way to gather the Badges is to defeat every Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! My most sincere congratulations on defeating Gym Leader Milo! Please accept this TM to commemorate your victory.
Here, you can have Milo’s uniform to go with it! It’s a replica, of course.
The Grass Badge looks good on you! Keep at it, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

Thanks, Yamper![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wow wow!
I had you come ’cause I wanted to hear what you thought.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, that geoglyph... What do you think of it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Darkest Day?
Dynamax?
Right perceptive of you. Especially since the portion depicting the black storm has mostly disappeared.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems likely... It certainly looks like a gigantic Pokémon. I suppose people three thousand years ago could’ve just imagined this, but it looks too similar to Dynamax. It can’t just be coincidence.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A long time ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. Giant Pokémon ran rampant... But what was that black storm they called “the Darkest Day”? What connection does it have to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Guess I’m the lucky lady who’ll be looking into that... Gran sure gives me a lot to do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for your thoughts on the matter! As thanks, I’ll give you a League Card.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Milo’s a Grass-type Gym Leader. Things will go well for you if you use Fire-, Flying-, or Bug-type moves. Take these, too! It’d be pretty bad if your Pokémon weren’t in fighting form![VAR 0114(000B)]
Go on, then! Get yourself to Turffield Stadium and battle yourself silly![VAR 0114(000B)]

Take a look at this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Grass Gym Badge! I got it in one try![VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon I’m just about the greatest when it comes to wrangling Wooloo... I’ve had plenty of practice at it, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure you can win this one, too. After all, you are my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]

Some advice for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. The Gym Challenge has a set order you’ll need to follow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So that means your next stop should be in Hulbury to meet Nessa. Hulbury’s just beyond Route 5. Or since you’ve got the Grass Badge, you could head to the Wild Area. It’s a bit tricky to catch Pokémon that are a higher level than the Pokémon on your team, but they make powerful allies if you succeed![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oi! Just hand over that bike already! We need it to cross this long bridge![VAR 0114(006F)]
We’re gonna use that bike to chase around Gym Challengers! It’ll be a scream![VAR 0114(006F)]
How barbaric! It wouldn’t work anyway. You don’t even have a Rotom with you!
Hey, young Gym Challenger! They’re trying to steal my bike! Please, if you could give them a good thrashing, I would be in your debt!
Oi, we’re not tryin’ to steal the bike! Only borrow it! We’re gonna use it to chase after Gym Challengers and make ’em all tired! But I’m thinkin’ you deserve a special shout-out. I’m gonna crush you in a battle![VAR 0114(006F)]
Gah... You crushed my attempt to crush you.[VAR 0114(006F)]
Why you... I want that bike! Don’t get in my way![VAR 0114(006F)]
You’re too strong! If you stay in the Gym Challenge, you’re gonna cause problems for our lady! You ’aven’t seen the last of us! We’re gonna make sure you stay out of our lady’s way![VAR 0114(006F)]
My word, you’re quite the Trainer! And I see you have a Pokédex, too! That means you have a Rotom with you! Fantastic! I think I’ll give this bike to you, then. Better you have it than Team Yell!
Now, you know that Rotom love motors very, very much, right? Enough to jump right into machines that have motors! So, that got me thinking... If I attached a motor to a bicycle, then maybe I could get a Rotom to pop into that as well!
Right...
I see
Come now—give it a shot! Enjoy cycling together with Rotom to the fullest.
Chop, chop, come on now! You and Rotom ride that bicycle together!
I’ll read the manual. “Press the + Button or - Button to ride your bike with Rotom. Let’s get cycling!”

I warned you! We’re both Gym Challengers who’ve earned ourselves a Grass Badge. This is the perfect training![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotten strong, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Seems I’ve got to train even harder from now on.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Our sincerest apologies! The chairman is quite busy at the moment... Everyone, please disperse! Please leave now![VAR 0114(0042)]
OK. See you later, Chairman. ♪
No need to rush off! I can still do more autographs! I’ll even give you my Pokémon League Card![VAR 0114(0006)]
We need the support of our fans to keep doing what we’re doing. Chasing them off like that... Aren’t you being a bit too harsh, Oleana?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Fans are very important, of course. That’s why you need to keep doing your work— for their sake.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I promise to do everything in my power to assist you, too, Chairman![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, and you were...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Bede, sir.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right! Bede! I daresay I’m impressed how far you’ve come since I gave you that Pokémon all those years ago.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Will you be the one to win the Gym Challenge? Or perhaps it will be one of the Trainers endorsed by the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I will prove your faith in me was well placed, Chairman. I won’t lose to anyone! Anyway, I will be on my way now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, your name was...[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right? We were just talking about you! I admit I’m curious about Leon’s reasons for endorsing you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah! I just had a good idea, as I tend to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re going to face Gym Leader Nessa soon, yes? If you get a Gym Badge from her, I’ll hold a celebration. I’d like to get to know you a little better, after all![VAR 0114(0006)]
Chairman, we should really be going...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please do your best, for the sake of Galar’s future![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey there, Gym Challenger! Shall we start the process to get you ready for the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!
Please wait
Understood! Please come back whenever you’re ready.
That’s right! You’ll have to change into your uniform. The changing room is located over there.
All right, you’re in your uniform! Head on in to the Gym mission! Ah, by the way, while you’re on the Gym mission, you can’t use your Pokémon Box Link.
Ah, well, you see...Leader Nessa is actually out by the lighthouse right now. Would you mind going to get her? The lighthouse is toward the ocean, after you exit the stadium.
Ah, the Gym mission, right? Don’t give up! My favorite saying is “the persistent raindrops will carve through stone”!

However, some paths in the maze are blocked by water. What should you do then?
Try pressing that red button over there, and I imagine you’ll figure it out, future champ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Press the buttons to change the flow of the falling water, and try to reach the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Then on with you! And good luck!

Welcome, honored Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000F)]
I think you already realize, but I’m Nessa. Sorry to have made you look for me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t doubt my humble mission’s difficulty... Yet you cleared it. Your mind as a Pokémon Trainer must be quite refined.[VAR 0114(000F)]
No matter what kind of plan your refined mind may be plotting, my partner and I will be sure to sink it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
How...? How can this be?![VAR 0114(000F)]
*sigh* Now that I’ve battled you, I think I understand.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Continue to seize victories in the Gym Challenge with your Pokémon. You have an incredible spirit that may even be strong enough to challenge the Champion.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You and your Pokémon are indeed deserving of this Gym Badge.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 30!
You’ll want to challenge the Fire Gym Leader next. As you and your Pokémon are now, he’ll definitely want to battle you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! My sincere congratulations for your victory over Gym Leader Nessa. Please take this commemorative TM.
Take this, too. It’s a replica of Nessa’s uniform!
Now that you’ve won the Water Badge, I’ll be watching to see just how far you and your Pokémon can go!
You’ve defeated the Gym Leader, Nessa! My sincerest congratulations!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
You decided to return to the reception desk.

Oh, were you invited, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two know each other? That’s great! Come now—please be seated.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hulbury is a seafood town. Naturally, if one is going to eat here, the obvious choice is the local cuisine! Everything on the menu is delicious.[VAR 0114(0006)]
By the way, how is Professor Magnolia getting on?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m quite indebted to her, you know. She was the one who figured out how to unleash the power of Wishing Stars and use that power to Dynamax Pokémon. We would never have been able to create Dynamax Bands without her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh* She was saying that there’s still so much we don’t know about Dynamaxing. It’s causing her some worry.[VAR 0114(000B)]
She even made me take a Power Spot Detector with me when I started traveling...[VAR 0114(000B)]
A Power Spot Detector! That’s the device that allowed me to discover the Power Spots... Locations that emit Galar particles and allow Pokémon to Dynamax![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t like hearing that Professor Magnolia is so worried, though. If only there were something I could do...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sonia, it may be good for you to visit the vault in Hammerlocke. I believe the key to unlocking the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon lies in the history preserved there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Understood, Chairman. I will arrange a meeting with Ms. Sonia.[VAR 0114(0007)]
However, I believe it is about time we get going, Chairman.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hm? But I’ve hardly had a chance to speak with [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! It’s regrettable, but I suppose it can’t be helped. If something needs to get done, there’s no time like the present, after all! In any case, I bid you all farewell![VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh* Does he think he’s doing me a favor? He’s right that the vault would be a good place to look for info on the legends, but...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You got the Water Badge, yeah? Defeating Nessa’s no small feat. Here’s a TM as a reward![VAR 0114(000B)]

How about I share with you a little tip about that Leader Kabu? From what I heard, he’s holed up now in Galar Mine No. 2, undergoing some special training![VAR 0114(0005)]
If he’s in there, then we can’t take him on in Motostoke even if we zip right over there— putting the brakes on our Gym Challenge. So I say we head to Galar Mine No. 2 ourselves! Let’s go see what all the fuss is about![VAR 0114(0005)]

You again...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’d feel sorry for my Pokémon if I made them take part in a battle against low-level opponents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not in the mood to deal with weaklings right now. Then again, I suppose it’s a form of mercy to crush weak opponents early on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’re under the misguided impression that you’re stronger than me, then surely you would be up for a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally!
Hold on a minute...
It’s utterly inconceivable that I, the challenger chosen by the chairman, will lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmph! I’ve no time to deal with pathetic Trainers![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, pardon me. It seems I must take back my words. You’re not weak—you just lack talent. Your chances of completing the Gym Challenge are pretty slim, I must say. Here, I’ll give you this. Something to show you at least tried.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, where shall I go next to collect Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m just gonna keep my mouth shut... Otherwise, his Pokémon will just knock me down again... Nah, not doin’ that...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Well, look at you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Surrounded by adoring fans, eh? You’ll even be showing up Lee pretty soon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, jog on, mate! Can’t you see we’re in the middle of a conversation here?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah? And can’t you see that I’m Hop, the Trainer who’ll be your next Champion?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oooh, so we’ve got a joker here, eh? You’re so funny, I forgot to laugh.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You think I’m joking? I’ll prove it, then! And I think a battle with you lot would definitely end with some laughs![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s take ’em on together, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You ready, mate?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The two of us were endorsed by the Champion himself! We’ll show you just what that means![VAR 0114(0005)]
Got it! Then get yourself all ready for a good battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, if you insist... Team Yell’s gonna teach you kids that the Gym Challenge’s no joke! You better not be yell-ow![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’d this other kid have to come waltzin’ up for, eh? I just wanted to knock off challengers one at a time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Nice one, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! That’s my rival for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now then... Where could Kabu have gone off to? Let’s keep going. Maybe he’s farther in![VAR 0114(0005)]
That little mug’s the Champion’s little brother... Guess that’s what you get when your older brother’s not useless...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Gor?
Oi, can’t you see me spendin’ some quality time here with my beloved Carkol? You’re not tryin’ to disturb us, are you? If you are, I’ll just have to make it clear you’re not welcome![VAR 0114(0043)]
I was the strongest one in Galar Mine No. 2, but now my spot’s been taken...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s your problem, eh? Here we had the brilliant idea to block the path while passin’ the time showin’ Carkol a bit of love, and then you come along![VAR 0114(0044)]
Retreat! That’s it, lads! Leave the Pokémon behind and leg it![VAR 0114(005E)]
Cleared them right off, eh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, have I got this straight? Those fanatics were only in our way...so they could spend a bit of time playing with Carkol?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph. It seems I made the right decision, letting the rabble deal with the rabble. The only thing weak Trainers like yourselves are good for is clearing my path.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry you had to deal with that, Carkol. Were you in the middle of a Poké Job, then? Go on! Break those rocks, and hurry back safe to your Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
Goooooor!
Actually... You two aren’t even all that useful in clearing my path, compared to that Pokémon. Still, I suppose you did take care of Team Yell. Here’s something for your trouble.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rrrgh! That little—![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do you suppose that Carkol found its way back to its Trainer all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wonder... Where has Kabu wandered off to?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you for helping out with my training, Team Yell! But I must say... it’s unforgivable for you to get in the way of a Carkol hard at work![VAR 0114(0010)]
We weren’t gettin’ in its way! We were tryin’ to cheer it on![VAR 0114(0043)]
Still, you did a number on us in that Pokémon battle, so...it’s time for Team Yell to scarper and give a morale boost elsewhere![VAR 0114(0044)]
Goooooor!
Cheering is one thing, but one shouldn’t get in the way of honest work![VAR 0114(0010)]
That’s Kabu... Man, he’s wicked! No wonder he’s the Fire-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, you are the Trainers endorsed by Leon! Hop and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], am I right? I’m just training right up until the last moment so that I can guarantee the perfect match when I face you Gym Challengers![VAR 0114(0010)]
I specialize in Fire-type Pokémon, and the Water-type Pokémon in Galar Mine No. 2 are the perfect opponents to train against![VAR 0114(0010)]
Regardless, it’s getting late. Just go straight once you get out of this mine, and you’ll reach Motostoke. Get a good rest at the hotel, and make sure you’re both in your top condition![VAR 0114(0010)]
Come on, Carkol. Time for you to head on home, too. I’ll make sure you get there safely.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Gooor!
We’re going to be on fire tomorrow![VAR 0114(0010)]
I remember Lee talking about Kabu. He said that a lot of Gym Challengers give up because they just can’t beat Kabu.[VAR 0114(0005)]

I do
Poké what?
Course you do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like there’s no helping it, in that case... Settle down and let Professor Hop teach you a thing or two! Let’s see if I can remember what Lee had written down in his old notebooks... Basically, you can have your Pokémon go about and help companies or other folks who are in need of something. You can take Poké Jobs from the Rotomi at any Pokémon Center, so give it a look sometime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, I’m cream-crackered! I’m for the Budew Drop Inn and some sleep. Come tomorrow, that Fire Gym Leader Kabu better be ready, because I’ll be coming for him![VAR 0114(0005)]
Burning the midnight oil, are we? If you’re here for the Gym Challenge, you won’t be able to challenge Kabu till the morning.
For now, it’d be best to simply get yourself a good night’s rest at the Budew Drop Inn!

I’ve already gone and earned my Fire Badge![VAR 0114(0005)]
That man of fire Kabu is just what you’d expect. Nearly got burnt in my battle with him! Even with my strongest team, it was definitely touch-and-go...but I still won in the end![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get a shift on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I bet you could beat the man of fire, too![VAR 0114(0005)]

A Gym Challenger! Ah, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu, you’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in Turffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger! And you’ve even earned your first two Badges! But I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to Galar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special training with his team. You might want to head to Hulbury and try to catch him in the mines on the way back here.
Hey, a Gym Challenger! That’s a welcome sight! We don’t have too many challengers, since our Leader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard... But I’ll be happy to get you registered at once!
I’m ready!
Not yet
Roger that! I’ll be here, so come back when you’re ready to challenge our Gym!
If you’re here to challenge our Gym, we’ll ask you to change into your uniform first...
Congratulations on clearing the Gym mission! You had that one in the bag, eh? Next up will be your match against Leader Kabu. I wonder which one of you will burn brighter?
You may find the Fire Gym’s mission a bit different than others you’ve faced. In you go!
Please take this TM to commemorate what you accomplished here today!
And take one of our uniforms. It’s the same design as Kabu himself wears.
Few enough people challenge Leader Kabu, and even fewer manage to defeat him... It’ll be a treat to see how such a promising Trainer does in the Gym Challenge!
Back for our Gym mission, are you? Good luck racking up those points!
[~ 13]
Heya, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I was on fire in my battle against that Kabu![VAR 0114(0005)]

The Gym mission for the Fire Gym is this! Catching Pokémon to earn the most points!
Earn five points to clear the Gym mission! In case you were wondering, you’ll earn one point for defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass or two points for catching a Pokémon. But you won’t be alone in this competition. Other Trainers will be joining you in your battles!
Think about what your opponents might do, and try to take the best action to rack up points!
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Get five points to clear the mission! Defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass gets you one point, but catching a Pokémon gets you two!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Well done! That’s the way to clear a Gym mission!
Next you’ll be facing Kabu, the leader of the Fire Gym! On you go, Challenger!
Right you are! Then on you go, Challenger!
A cautious one, are you? Get yourself all sorted first, in that case.
Then on with you! And good luck!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission completed!
Clearing Leader Kabu’s Gym mission like that... You’re positively on fire!
Congratulations on another mission cleared!
[~ 20]
Now [VAR NUM1(0001)] more point[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s needed to clear the Fire Gym mission! Keep that fire burning! (Gym Leader Kabu)

Oh my word, is Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] really going to end this thing with naught?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Your target is the wild Pokémon! Don’t concern yourself with the other Trainers!
The other Gym Trainers are all stronger than me! Be careful out there!
Status conditions are the greatest! Getting burned will land you in real hot water!
A Full Heal can cure any sort of status condition!
Study the situation, and choose your opponent wisely based on it!
We won’t let you get through the Fire Gym’s mission that easily!

Welcome! I am Kabu, the Fire-type Gym Leader. The fact that you are here means you’ve bested both Milo’s Grass-type Pokémon and Nessa’s Water types, too. That’s quite an accomplishment![VAR 0114(0010)]
Every Trainer and Pokémon trains hard in pursuit of victory. But that means your opponent is also working hard to win. In the end, the match is decided by which side is able to unleash their true potential.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m often regarded as the first real roadblock of the Gym Challenge, and yet you defeated me! Clearly, your talent surpassed my many years of experience. I still have much to learn![VAR 0114(0010)]
I know now that you and your Pokémon will become a fantastic team. I’m glad I could battle you today![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let me give you a Fire Badge as proof that you’ve defeated me![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 35!
Thanks to the Dynamax phenomenon, our Pokémon battles have become part of the Galar region’s culture.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And it’s the young Trainers who are responsible for keeping our culture alive. Of course, I hope that instead of just keeping it alive, you also help it become something better. We adults will be the pillars for you to build on.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I see you’ve done a fine job collecting the Gym Badges from the Grass, Water, and Fire Gyms.
I think you’ve proven your skill well enough to try your hand against the Gyms that await you, starting in the city of Hammerlocke.
Head back down into the Wild Area surrounding this city, then make your way to Hammerlocke!
With all the Badges we’ve earned ourselves, I reckon we should be all right even against the fierce Pokémon you find deep in the Wild Area. Let’s go find out for ourselves![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hurry it up, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re the Gym Leader, but you still came all the way to see us off? Oh, I bet you can already tell that I’m the one who’ll become the next Champion, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are many Trainers who never manage to gather three Gym Badges, and they just give up on the Gym Challenge altogether... So I make a point to see off any Trainers who are able to defeat me.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Whew, we made it... Thank goodness for Flying Taxis![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], Hop, congratulations! It’s pretty amazing you two defeated Kabu![VAR 0114(000F)]
Not a lot of Gym Challengers are able to get a Gym Badge from Kabu. We like to get together to see them off, as a way of showing our support.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So, allow me to send you off with a proper, sporty chant![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, Hop! You can do it, you can do it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
The Gym Leaders you will face ahead are all tough opponents. But I believe that you will prevail! Believe in your Pokémon and keep pushing on![VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks, you all! We’re gonna keep winning! We’ve got to if we want a face-off in the Champion Cup, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s head for Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Look into yourself for things you lack. Those who understand their own weaknesses learn and grow the most![VAR 0114(0010)]
You run into a lot of unexpected things when you work as a farmer. Same thing with Pokémon battles. Just don’t give up and things will work out.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s nothing wrong with stoically facing challenges, but push yourselves too hard, and you’ll pop. If you ever feel maxed out, come up for a breather at the seafood restaurant.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Don’t waste your efforts. It’s not like either of you would ever make it through the Gym Challenge, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The Champion really must have been off his rocker to endorse the likes of you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I mean, it seems Hop here can’t even throw a Poké Ball properly.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rubbish. More like you don’t know enough to recognize greatness when you see it. My throws are the greatest, and my bro is the finest Champion the world has ever seen! I’m not gonna listen to you insulting him![VAR 0114(0005)]
How tiresome... Fine. I’ll battle you over there. Maybe that will help you finally understand just how weak you are.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You’re on then. I know you challenged [VAR TRNAME(0000)] to battle in Galar Mine No. 2 and lost to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer there. And I’m h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser greatest rival. In other words...there’s no way you’re beating me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
All this prattle about [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and the Champion and whatnot... Do you not have anything of your own to show?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll show this wally my real skills in battle! So, see you later, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s meet up in Hammerlocke when I’m through with him![VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s confirmed that you’ve defeated three Gym Leaders, including the leader of Motostoke! I wish you the best of luck in your future battles!
Oh, it’s you... I doubt Hop will be coming.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s only natural. After such a humiliating defeat, there’s no way he could look the Champion in the eye. I’m sure he’ll withdraw from the challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here, just look at the Gym Badges I’ve already won.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you, Challenger Bede. I can confirm you have the required Badges!
Anyway, I have a meeting with the chairman, so I must excuse myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet. You can’t enter without the Fire Badge. Would you like me to take you back to the bridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Of course. In that case...
Please don’t overexert yourself.

Mr. Chairman! I’ve been collecting both Wishing Stars and Gym Badges as fast as I can![VAR 0114(000C)]
Good work, Bede. I’m glad you haven’t forgotten that it was the chairman who endorsed you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I gather enough Wishing Stars, that’ll help solve the problem that’s been bothering you, right, Mr. Chairman?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, it’s not just about me. It’s for the future of the whole Galar region.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And we’ll need more than just Wishing Stars. We need a powerful Pokémon Trainer, too— someone like the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
With all due respect, sir, I was able to show Hop, one of the Champion-endorsed Trainers, just how outclassed he was.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sure I’ll be able to defeat the Champion. No, I WILL defeat the Champion![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s the spirit! It takes healthy competition to really keep the Gym Challenge energized![VAR 0114(0006)]
Challenger Bede, there is something I wish to discuss with you. Do you have a moment?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I hope you were listening, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
As you know, Wishing Stars are those mysterious stones that are even attached to your Dynamax Bands.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s more to Wishing Stars than just making your Pokémon into giants, though! They hold far more energy than that![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’re curious, you should head to the stadium. In fact, we should head inside right away! I’ll even give you a little lesson on how the Galar region gets its energy![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hammerlocke’s stadium doubles as an Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, have a look at my tablet. I’ve got all the information you need on it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
See? An easy-to-understand description of the Energy Plant!
First, energy is absorbed from Hammerlocke Stadium’s tower...
Then, it’s changed into electricity in the underground power plant and delivered to people throughout the region!
Our lives and society require various types of energy sources, such as electricity, natural gas, and water.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My associate groups aim to improve everyone’s lives by harnessing the power stored in Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! It’s time for me to get to work. I should get a move on before Oleana decides to give me another earful.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], I suggest you head over to the vault next. Just head toward Route 6 from the stadium, and you should find the vault without any issues![VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Seems you’re doing well collecting Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But Hop... Did something happen with him? He was acting really odd when I ran into him. He took one look at me and immediately was like, “I’m so sorry, Lee!” It might be the first time I’ve heard him apologize for anything, and I’ve no idea what it was for![VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe he’s feeling down because he’s had some hard losses in battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
He lost to that Challenger Bede
I think so
When you lose, you feel down in the dumps. But then there’s nowhere left to go but back up! You’ve got to think on why it was you lost, though. You know, that little brother of mine...I think he might yet become a surprisingly great Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
At least I’ve got you to keep an eye on him. You will look out for Hop, won’t you? As his rival.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Blast, and look at the time! Nearly forgot my meeting with the chairman. That Oleana really lets me hear it when I’m late! Now if only I could remember which way to go...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’d say that you should go and say hello to Raihan while you’re here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. He’s the greatest rival I’ve got and the final hurdle you’ll have to face in the Gym Challenge. He should still be around the vault, if you hurry. It’s down that way—on the way to Route 6.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Ah, right! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
And if Leon himself recognized your potential... then I guess you’ll grow into quite the Trainer. All the same, though, anyone wanting to challenge the mighty Raihan has to prove they’re up to it by earning seven Gym Badges first.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I already knew that
I’m here to visit the vault
Ah, so you’re here to see our treasures, are you? Gaining a better understanding of Pokémon by studying history certainly isn’t a bad idea.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I like your spirit, kid! Follow me, why don’t you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll even spare you one of my League Cards.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now on you go! If it’s the vault you want, it’s up those stairs there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Weren’t you here to see the vault? That girl’s up there, too. You know. Miss Clever Clogs.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you want your chance to battle the great Raihan for yourself, collect those Gym Badges! You’ll need seven of them—and the next is waiting for you in Stow-on-Side, down Route 6.[VAR 0114(0017)]

The two youths watching a Wishing Star.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A disaster occurs... The two bewildered youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths looking on at the sword and shield that stop the disaster.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths being crowned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
These tapestries tell the story of the creation of a kingdom in Galar.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, young Gym Challenger, what sticks out to you most about them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s two heroes?
The Darkest Day?
Bang on! The statue at that hotel in Motostoke only had one hero, no matter how you slice it. But here, we clearly have two youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right? That’s got to be it. The story of the black storm that blotted out the skies was passed on through the years as a tale of disaster... That’s what the Darkest Day is![VAR 0114(000B)]
Was there really only one hero, or were there two? And what even caused the Darkest Day?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for letting me bounce some ideas off you. I think I’ve got some theories now. I’m going to research the tapestries a tad more, but you have your Gym Challenge, right? I’m cheering for you, so take a couple of these. I hope to see more of your wins![VAR 0114(000B)]

Of course! It’d be our pleasure.[VAR 0114(0043)]

I’ll battle them!
Let me think...
You... Yeah, that’s the spirit![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t figure thinking at them is going to change much about the situation. What else you got?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are way too noisy. You don’t wanna wake up Silicobra, now do you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I swear, kids these days... Well, we’ve got no choice. We have to send you packin’. It’s all for the sake of Silicobra![VAR 0114(0043)]
Think I’ll leave this to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Keep up the pace.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Silicobra might wake up after all that ruckus![VAR 0114(0044)]
Then there’s no point in us stickin’ around! Let’s get out of here! We’ll make these bothersome kids holler some other day![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... You and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] were brilliant together![VAR 0114(0005)]
See, Bede really wiped the floor with me the last time we battled... And don’t get me wrong—I can take a loss! Battling means you’ve got to lose sometimes.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But he said that I was dragging Lee’s good name through the mud, being so rubbish like I was... And I just can’t get those words out of my head![VAR 0114(0005)]
If I’m weak, then people’ll think Lee’s weak, too... But I don’t want that! I can’t let Lee get dragged down! He’s the unbeatable Champion! I’m gonna have to take some time figuring this out. See you around, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hrmmm... I tried switching my team members in and out to max out their potential in every matchup, but... We just couldn’t get it together somehow... Maybe that’s why I’m still so weak...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But Lee really is the greatest Trainer! And I don’t want people to be laughing at him all because his little brother is rubbish![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s not enough! I’ve got to try harder! And harder and harder till no one’s laughing! I’m off, mate! Off to find the kind of Pokémon that I can really draw the strength out of![VAR 0114(0005)]

But not good, either. And I think I know why. You need more pink. Here, have a look at this League Card. Maybe it’ll inspire you to add a little more pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I plan on putting you both to the test soon, so you better not slack off on your training![VAR 0114(0013)]
That child...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gym Challengers should battle for the sake of their own Pokémon. Why worry about saving the Champion’s name? We all know he’s unbeatable.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, here’s something for letting me watch your battle.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, on you go, child. You’re headed to the Stow-on-Side Gym next, no? The Gym Challenge is about having fun.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Hm! Then head to the changing room and change into your uniform. Then go to the Gym mission room.
Well, I guess that’s one option. I’ll be waiting here if you change your mind.
Go, number [VAR 01C4(0000)]!

Allow me to explain the Gym mission for Stow-on-Side’s Gym!
Please do
No, thanks
To complete the mission, you’ll need to ride in one of these cups and make your way to the goal while trying to avoid obstacles!
Let me tell you a bit more about how to operate this fun attraction. Rotate your control stick to the right and the cup will start to spin to the right. Rotate it to the left to make the cup spin left!
If you hit a wall, rotate the stick as quick as you can to get yourself out of that sticky situation! Now, have a good time watching the world spin as you try to reach the goal!
Then on you spin! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Use the control stick to spin your cup, and make your way to the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!

Welcome, Gym Challenger. I’m Bea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Do you have an unshakable spirit that won’t be moved, no matter how you are attacked? I think I’ll just test that out, shall I?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you for the battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Phew... Facing you gave me all the explanation I needed.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Battling against you and your team... I hadn’t expected it, but it made my heart dance. It’s good to be unshakable in the face of battle. But it’s good to be moved by battle, as well.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you again. Take the Fighting Badge.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 40!
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Congratulations on defeating Leader Bea! Please take this TM to remember your victory by!
And take one of our Fighting Gym uniforms as well, as a souvenir.
The Fighting Badge suits you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I hope you’ll carry on just as you’ve been doing!

You know the mural here in Stow-on-Side? It’s said to tell the story of the hero of Galar as well. Though what’s there today is actually a replica of the ancient art that used to be here...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You tend to have surprisingly sharp insight, so I was wondering what you might think when you see the ruins.[VAR 0114(000B)]
*Ka-BOOM*
Wha...? What in the world was that? Sounds like it came from the direction of the ruins, too...[VAR 0114(000B)]

I was the one chosen by the chairman... I was the one who was to defeat the Champion... I’m one of the elite—someone who can shoulder the future of the Galar region![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wondered what you were up to when you asked to borrow Chairman Rose’s Copperajah... I can’t believe you’d try to use the chairman’s Pokémon to destroy a historical site![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who cares for some ancient ruin when the next thousand years are at stake?! Did you stand in the path of a Pokémon’s Simple Beam or something? How do you expect to support the chairman with that sort of thinking?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Young Bede...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It pains me to have to say this, but... I am truly disappointed. It’s true that I am the one who found you, back when you were all alone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I saw talent in you. You reminded me a little bit of myself, back when I was young. That’s why I sent you to a Trainers’ school, to give you a chance at success.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But trying to destroy the mural—part of Galar’s history! You show no love toward Galar! You are clearly not a worthy challenger for the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We will decide what to do with you later. For now, you will return to Hammerlocke.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You...you must be joking, right? You’re disqualifying me from the Gym Challenge? But you’re the one who endorsed me! There are a hundred different ways we could sort this out... Why are you choosing the worst possible option?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede. I will be taking those Wishing Stars that you have gathered.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, Sonia! And [VAR TRNAME(0000)], too. Terrible shame, all this. An absolute disaster. I never wish to see us lose challengers for this sort of reason. Yet we do what we must do to keep things fair and sportsmanlike.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, during one of Bede’s matches, I heard the announcer say that Bede has no family. Apparently it was Rose who took Bede under his wing, and so Bede was battling for the chairman’s sake.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What an awful turn of events... I hope the mural survived all that.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Not a brilliant turn of events, but the ruins were brought into the light for us to see...[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does this tell us about Galar’s legends?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pokémon?
A sword and shield?
Right! More than any hero, there’s those things that appear to be Pokémon that stand out! Not just that, but those Pokémon appear to be holding a sword and shield as if they were using them![VAR 0114(000B)]
Anything else look interesting to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The hero...was actually two people?
The same as the tapestries?
Oh, good observation! There really were two heroes. But if that’s the case, then why only the one statue at the Budew Drop Inn?[VAR 0114(000B)]
More than any statue of a hero or old tapestry, these ruins made in truly ancient times must show us the real truth.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which means...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The sword is a Pokémon!
The shield is a Pokémon!
Yup! I was thinking the same thing! Seems like at some point in history the sword and shield were combined with the two actual Pokémon and treated as the same thing... But then what? They just faded from history?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Two young heroes... The sword and shield were actually Pokémon... But why would the truth of these ruins be hidden when their stories were depicted in artwork?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With your help, I really feel like we made a big discovery here. Thanks! I’ll give you a couple of these, so you keep giving it your best in the Gym Challenge, too, OK? Guess you’ll be headed to Ballonlea next, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So... There was history being covered up by all that over-stylized artwork... I’m gonna have to look into this some more.[VAR 0114(000B)]

That uniform looks good on you. Now relax, clear your mind, and go break a leg.
Goodness... That is a shame. How quick you were to give up.
I hope you enjoy the little examination we call our Gym’s mission.
You received a TM from Leader Opal, yes? The next Gym waits for you in Circhester.

Ah, there you are, my dear Gym Challenger. Though you are really lacking in the color pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See, I’m looking for a successor to take on the role of Gym Leader here. So my Gym mission serves as an audition of sorts, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, don’t worry. It’s simple enough. All you need to do is battle my Trainers and answer the questions they ask along the way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think carefully before answering, though, child. If you get the wrong answer, the stats of your Pokémon will get lowered. Oh, but if you answer correctly, your Pokémon will get a stat boost. Just think of it as a little Fairy-type Pokémon magic to make things interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Try to achieve victory while answering the questions given by the Gym Trainers!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
In that case, good luck!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Gym mission! Now, I wonder if you’ve met the standards of the Gym Leader. Would you like to immediately challenge the Gym Leader, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
I’m good to go!
I need some time
Right! Then head on in! Give my regards to the Gym Leader!
Of course. You probably need to save a record of your progress and whatnot.
All right, OK. It’s time to start your audition to see if you’re worthy of becoming the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
I see... I can’t say what Ms. Opal will think, but you’ve at least piqued my interest.
I’m the second Trainer. Don’t worry about the last question. Let’s keep moving forward.
Don’t worry about right or wrong. Just keep moving forward.
I’m next. I think you might have what it takes to become the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
We should be focusing on the Gym Challenge, but Ms. Opal insisted on making this an audition.

Well, good try.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Not bad, not bad at all. Still, not what I’m looking for... Oh, don’t worry yourself about it, child. It’s just a matter of my preference.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll find the next Gym Leader elsewhere. In fact, I’ve already got an idea about where to look.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Too bad about the audition, but here’s a Fairy Badge for your efforts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 45!
Take this TM with you, too. A little bonus from this old lady.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lastly, here’s a little something for humoring me. This might help add a little more pink to you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Of course it’s not good to neglect your elders, but old folk like me should also know when it’s time to step out of the spotlight.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There were a total of six questions! Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you got... [VAR NUM1(0001)] of them correct.

I’ll find my own way
They say two’s company, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I like that attitude, child. Still, you’re in the middle of the Gym Challenge, are you not? You’ll need to head back to Hammerlocke either way if you want to get to Circhester.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Hm? That boy...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that’s what I would call pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Come to gawk at me now that I’ve had my Challenge Band taken away and my Gym Challenger status revoked? Can you really afford to waste time like this?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course!
Not really...
Well, I suppose so. You no longer have to worry about catching up with me, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I commend your humility. It is appropriate for a Trainer of your...limited talents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll have you know, though, that I haven’t given up! I must become the Champion in order to help out the chairman! I will go and ask him to let me rejoin the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
So sincere and straightforward and yet so twisted and misguided... I like it! That’s the kind of thing that gives people some depth![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, listen. I’ll let you attempt my Gym mission, even if you’re not a Gym Challenger. In fact, I don’t plan on giving you a choice, so don’t even think about refusing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Time for my Gym mission, child![VAR 0114(0013)]

You are most definitely pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
M-Ms. Opal? What in the world has gotten into you?![VAR 0114(000C)]
You were used by Oleana—am I right? You worked hard to gather Wishing Stars for her, only to have her throw you away like rubbish once she was done with you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come with me, child. I might be able to help you out. Of course, it all depends on how much hard work you’re willing to put in, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are you... Are you testing me? Very well, I accept! In fact, I plan on making sure you see my full talents and tell me everything you know about the Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000C)]
Farewell for now, child. You should head to Circhester. I take it you know how to get to Route 7.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Oh! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
First that forest, then that mad quiz... I’ve been lost in every sense of the word! But it looks like I’ve finally caught up to you again.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come with me to Route 7! I could use a bit of competition to motivate me![VAR 0114(0005)]

All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and I both know I’ve got to keep on trying different strategies if I’m gonna get strong enough to catch up to Lee... No! Not just catch up! If I want to surpass him![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I think you know what’s coming, mate... Let me try out my latest in a battle against you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Before we ever started out on this journey... I remember watching Lee on the telly. He was like a bright star, so strong I could hardly bear to look right at him.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But now, I can tell just how strong he really is... And what he’s got that I haven’t...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m getting stronger, too. Maybe not as fast as you, but fine. Whatever! Thanks for letting me battle with you again. And here. I’ll heal up your team for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I know what it is I really want... I want to battle Lee—I want to take on my bro. But not just that, I want to beat him! I want to be the one who beats the unbeatable Champion! And I’m going to![VAR 0114(0005)]
My mind’s made up! You and me are going to have another battle once I get my Gym Badge in Circhester![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger. Do you want to attempt the Gym mission?
Of course!
Let me think
If you want to attempt the mission, then you’ll need to change into your uniform. The dressing room’s that way.
Make sure to receive the Trap Detector up ahead, too. You’ll need it for the Gym mission.
There may be some things you can’t overcome without pushing yourself at least a little.
You’re here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite sayings is “determination will move mountains”!
You look smashing in that uniform!

Would you like to hear the details of the Gym mission carried out here in Circhester?
I would!
I’m good...
Then allow me to explain a little about the Trap Detector you hold in your hands!
The reason you’ll need it is simple. There are invisible pitfalls everywhere in here!
If you fall into one, you’ll have to start again from the last platform you reached. The detector will vibrate when there’s a pitfall in front of you. The closer the hole, the stronger the vibration!
Then on with you! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Try to reach the goal without falling into any of the invisible pitfalls!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission! So what do you say, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Would you like to face the Gym Leader at once?
I would!
I’d rather not...
Very well! Move on ahead, and show that Gym Leader what you can do!
Of course. You no doubt have to prepare and save a record of what you’ve done. I understand!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
Oooh, that’s a right shame! And Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] goes down!

Hey there. The name’s Gordie.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So you managed to reach me without falling into any of the holes... Of course, you’d stand no chance against me if you let a few holes get in your way.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I admit I feel a little bad for doing this to a Gym Challenger, but... I’m going to use this match to show the crowd that my Pokémon are unbeatable![VAR 0114(0014)]
So, let’s get this over with, Challenger![VAR 0114(0014)]
That was...impressive.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rules are rules. Here, take this Rock Badge.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
Oh, don’t worry about me. I just need to train harder, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
As celebration of your victory over Gordie, take this TM!
And here’s a special uniform! It’s the same design that Gordie wears, and that means it’s extra cool!
The Rock Badge looks good on you! You’re doing great, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

I am Melony. As you can clearly see, I’ve assembled a team of all Ice-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, fancy that! You made it all the way to me without falling in a hole. If I’m not careful, you could sweep my feet right out from under me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You! You aren’t sore all over from falling in a hole or two, are you? Even if you are, I’m not going to hold back![VAR 0114(0015)]
All righty, I suppose we should get started. You won’t be able to escape when I freeze you solid. And after that... Well, you’ll see. I think you’ll find my battle style is quite severe.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You... You’re pretty good, huh? Of course seeing my Pokémon lose is sad, but to meet someone so young with such ability is quite grand.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Here, take this sparkling Ice Badge![VAR 0114(0015)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
For some reason, I can’t help but imagine my son challenging you after you become the Champion. If that time comes...give him a right thrashing, would you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! My sincere congratulations for your victory over Gym Leader Melony. Please take this commemorative TM.
Here’s a uniform for you, too. It’s the same as what Melony wears, so it’s a quite popular replica!

That battle was brilliant! That Gym Leader was tough, but you had no trouble.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Circhester has some really great restaurants.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I got some things I want to talk to you about, so let’s head to a restaurant to celebrate your win! The name of the restaurant is Bob’s Your Uncle![VAR 0114(000B)]

Got that Gym Badge, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Nice one![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hey! There you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been trying to find out more about the Darkest Day and the sword and shield Pokémon, but still no luck...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! Hold on![VAR 0114(000B)]
No way! What’s this?![VAR 0114(000B)]
A new chapter in the old Galar legends?
A fifth tapestry!
An absolutely fantastic poster!
Exactly! Bob, with his brilliant smile, must be part of the legend![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait, what are you on about?! Don’t confuse me![VAR 0114(000B)]
The heroes look sad... And where are the sword and shield? What was the meaning of this picture?[VAR 0114(000B)]
An end to the legend?
Some kind of seal?
Hmm... Perhaps when their duty was completed, they went into some kind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You think so? I guess it could be that they were sealed away. Or maybe they’ve gone into some kind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Based on those statues we saw back in Stow-on-Side, the sword and the shield were actually two Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right! That’s my take on it, at least.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember the Pokémon we met that day? Do you think...it could’ve been one of them? Either the sword or the shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You...met them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on! You know what I’m talking about, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
In the Slumbering Weald?
I really don’t
Exactly! The mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog! Don’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Not so sharp when it’s not about battle, huh? Don’t you remember that mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog that day? Don’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s right! You lot have been in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I only started on this journey because my gran told me to, but this is turning out to be too much fun! You’ve got to tell me more. How about we discuss this over a meal? Go on, what do you want to eat? Let’s get our orders in![VAR 0114(000B)]
Fascinating... All right, the next thing to do now that we’re done eating is to have a look around Circhester! Let’s inspect the Hero’s Bath![VAR 0114(000B)]

The Hero’s Bath... They say this is where the two heroes came to soothe their wounds after the battle to bring down that evil presence, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nowadays only Pokémon really use the Hero’s Bath, though... Hmm... Who exactly were the heroes that bathed here? I think I’ll have to look into that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two met a mysterious Pokémon back in the Slumbering Weald... Perhaps...you two can become new heroes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and shield? Pull the other one. Though...I guess I’d fancy a shield, if I had to take my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and shield? Pull the other one. Though...I guess I’d fancy a sword, if I had to take my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What kind of battle do you think the heroes had back then?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t we show her, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Think we can pull off a real heroic battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Give me a minute...
I’ve been getting stronger and stronger lately! I won’t lose to Lee, some hero, or even you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Come and have a go![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I get it. Prepare as much as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia treated us to a great meal. After that curry, I feel like I’ve got the energy to wrestle a Bewear![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t entirely understand your reasoning, but I might just as well see what you can do. I’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], so give it your best![VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for a little exhibition match, starring the future Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks! You two gave a right proper battle... At the rate you both are going, even the unbeatable Leon may be in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
So what’s next, you two? I plan to look into things in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m going to keep challenging that Gym! Then, once I get that Gym Badge, I’ll be heading for Route 9 to take on Spikemuth next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems like he finally shook off that gloom. Leon’d worry if Hop wasn’t feeling all right. As his rival, you wouldn’t like it either, right? See ya.[VAR 0114(000B)]

There’s no way we’re lettin’ you anywhere near Spikemuth! And that means we can’t let you go on to Route 9![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s Team Yell’s duty to cheer on these lovely Drednaw! And we also get to stop people from headin’ out over the water![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ba bite!
Yes, I understand... All I’m saying is that I can make it so that Rotom Bikes can ride on water...
Why, we meet again, my young Gym Challenger friend! Remember me? I gave you that bike! So, do you think you could do me another favor and teach these ruffians a lesson or two?
It’s our duty to protect Drednaw! And that means yer gonna need to give up on the Gym Challenge! You look like you need convincin’, so how about a Pokémon battle?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Then clear off, would ya? We’re busy cheerin’ on Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll send you packin’! For the sake of Drednaw, of course.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Even if you reach Spikemuth, it’s not like you’re gonna be able to do the Gym Challenge. Why not just give up now?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gah! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s gonna ride the Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oi! I’ve got an idea! We can get on Drednaw first and ride it away![VAR 0114(0044)]
All right! Get a move on, Drednaw! See ya later, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ba bite!
Seems you’ve come to my aid yet again. How’s the cycling life been treating you? Are you having fun?
Wouldn’t it be great if you could ride your Rotom Bike on the water, too?
That’s why I’m going to add these special parts, allowing it to travel along the water’s surface...just for you!
All right, all right! With the Rotom Bike “Water Mode,” you’ll cruise across the water like a Pokémon with Swift Swim! By the by, when you’re riding on land, we’ll call it “Land Mode.”

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
I was born ’ere so I know another way in.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you wanna get into the town, how ’bout I show you the way? But...you’re my rival. So you’ll have to beat me in a battle first, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
With pleasure!
Let me think about it
Oh, did I misjudge you...? Ahhh, I get it. You need to get ready! Go on, then! I’ll wait here until you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’ve had a pretty good win streak in the Gym Challenge, just like me! I respect you as my rival and all that, but I got too much at stake to go around losin’ now![VAR 0114(000D)]
My partner Morpeko has been interested in you and your strength, and I think I get it now. But I’ve got everyone in Spikemuth supportin’ me![VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m definitely gonna get all eight Gym Badges just so I can have a rematch with you. Don’cha forget it! I’ll get my revenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(000D)]

Oi! Welcome to Spikemuth, kid! Hope yer ready for the Gym mission![VAR 0114(0045)]
’Old on, mate. If you’re gonna take on the Gym mission, you’d better change into yer uniform![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Gym Leader, he’s straight ahead from here![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you head back, you’ll be retirin’. Do you wanna retire?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Step past there, and you’ll be givin’ up![VAR 0114(0045)]
Only one healthy Pokémon? You thinkin’ about turnin’ tail and yelleavin’?[VAR 0114(0045)]
You seriously beat Piers? Here—a TM to remember this moment![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hey! There’s some trouble over on Route 9! It’s so bad, even the Champion’s come to sort things out! Oh, hey! You gave Piers a thrashing, didn’t you? You should head over there to help. C’mon, then! I’ll show you the way.
Me? I’m just here as a part-time job. I’m fi-yellin’ in for the proper League staff.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Gym Leader’s waitin’ for you! Go right on ahead if you want to get trounced![VAR 0114(0045)]
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
Gym Challenger. You wanna get past me, but I don’t want that. Basically, it’s a battle between our desires.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I don’t wanna let you through! That’s why I was waitin’ all squeezed in this crack. But since I lost, it was really all for nothin’! Whatever. You won, so I guess I’ll step aside.[VAR 0114(0045)]
D’you know the Pokémon move Light Screen?[VAR 0114(0045)]
What’s this? A Gym Challenger made it through? All us Team Yell members have blocked the way. Don’t think we’ll just let you waltz through![VAR 0114(0045)]
That was...totally unbelievable. Even my Pokémon are in awe of you and your team. Here, go on through. Check out our neon signs while you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Mr. Mime is a dancin’ Pokémon... It makes for a cheery member of our team.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m yellin’ for no reason![VAR 0114(0045)]
Did I surprise you? I’m a little surprised how much my legs hurt from that landin’! If I stand still like this for too long, it’ll hurt so bad I might cry... So I’ll shake it off with a battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
Well, it’s true that I lost, but I pushed through the pain, so you should praise me for that! All right! Now that the pain’s gone, I guess I’d better get outta here.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The HP of your Pokémon not lookin’ so good?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I practiced that back handspring so much, even a pop star would be jealous of those moves. Were you surprised? Oi, be surprised, you! While you’re in utter shock, I’m gonna sneakily win this battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
I shoulda been practicin’ my battle skills, not my backflip skills... Thanks for showin’ me that. Guess I’ll cheer for you from now on.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Team Yell takes the field! This might be the Gym Challenge, but I won’t let you ruin our cool secret hangout![VAR 0114(0045)]
What?! You only got one healthy Pokémon? Oi, don’t come back unless you got a Revive or somethin’—got it?[VAR 0114(0045)]
All right, time for a pincer attack! We’ll do whatever it takes to win![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! I didn’t have enough time to get my disguise ready! That’s right! Team Yell is actually made up of Spikemuth Gym Trainers!
Ugh, whatever! Our Gym Leader’s up next, but he’s really strong. Got that?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I mean, everybody already knew the true identity of Team Yell, right? That means I won’t get in trouble for not gettin’ my disguise on, right? I sure hope so...
Bari bari!
There’s some kind of invisible wall! You can’t get through, no matter how you try!

Uh... I’m really sorry! The lot from Spikemuth’s tellin’ me they locked down the city for my sake...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Spikemuth just keeps gettin’ worse and worse. And all Piers says is “Don’t worry”...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So... So we decided to disguise ourselves as Team Yell and sabotage the other challengers.[VAR 0114(0044)]
We thought, if we could stop the other Gym Challengers from reachin’ the Gym, then Ms. Marnie would be the only one to win and make it to the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0043)]
And we figured that’d increase the chances of our wonderful Ms. Marnie becomin’ the new Champion![VAR 0114(0044)]
*sigh* That’s no way to help someone at all![VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], no need to bother with all the preparations, or whatever. Go on in and face the Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh man, Ms. Marnie’s scoldings go on forever... I remember once she scolded her Morpeko for so long, it practically fell asleep...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I can hear Piers just rockin’ away. His Pokémon chorus sounds pretty great, too.[VAR 0114(0044)]

I have good ears, so I overheard the whole thing about the city bein’ shut up. When I was alone, it was like my soul was weepin’.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is a simple Gym Stadium. We can’t even Dynamax our Pokémon, but well... I still hope you enjoy the battle.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m the Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, the Dark-type user![VAR 0114(0016)]
You wanna challenge me, even though you know you’ll lose? Then this song’s for you, foolish Trainer![VAR 0114(0016)]
Get ready for a mosh pit with me and my party! Spikemuth, it’s time to rock![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m glad we were able to battle. Seems like my Pokémon feel the same way.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Here’s your Dark Badge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 55!
Here’s a uniform, too... I’ve actually been thinkin’ about just sellin’ them at my concerts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My little sis Marnie’s gonna challenge me next, I bet.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

That was actually kinda sweet.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So you were watchin’, Sis... You won’t learn anythin’ from seein’ me lose.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was watchin’ YOUR battle, Bro. It’s how I learned to battle an’ all that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That right? That reminds me. Marnie, there’s somethin’ I wanted to tell you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I want you to take over the Gym here in Spikemuth as its Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah, I know. You’d planned to retire after the Champion Cup, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I think you’ve really become a great Gym Leader, even if you don’t Dynamax your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I love you, but my answer is a big, fat “NO”![VAR 0114(000D)]
I mean, when I end up becomin’ Champion, I won’t be able to be a Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Good point. In that case, let your big bro see if you have the skill to be a Champion![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], thanks for havin’ an amazin’ Pokémon battle with my brother. It’s my turn next! So clear off for a bit, ’K?[VAR 0114(000D)]

*Ka-BOOM*
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Thanks for coming, but I’ve got a handle on this! Whatever’s making that noise, I’ll see to it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I already told you, didn’t I? Keep your eye on the goal! And for you, that’s winning the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only Gym Badge left is the one you’ll get from the Dragon Gym’s Leader, Raihan. Right? Raihan is the only Trainer out there I consider a real rival. He’s that good, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]
And there I go again! Sorry, but I suppose this is no time for me to be stopping for a chat. There’s a bit of trouble here with my name on it. But don’t you worry about a thing![VAR 0114(0004)]
The unbeatable Champion is here to look after things and keep you all safe![VAR 0114(0004)]
*Ka-BOOM*
That came from the tunnel, wouldn’t you say? Seems I’m about to have a champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

This is mad... You know what I mean?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Where’s Leon?
What was that loud noise?
That’s what I’d like to know! That noise—it was like some massive explosion! There was this huge surge of red light, and then wild Pokémon just started Dynamaxing around me, brazen as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Take a look at the news![VAR 0114(0005)]
See! There’s Lee! He really is the greatest, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Lee and his Charizard took down that Dynamax Pokémon in the blink of an eye![VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew Lee was strong, but this! Really makes you appreciate how great he is, eh? Let’s go meet up with him, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! He should be at Hammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]

Over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, if it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d expect nothing less from you and your Charizard, Leon! You took down that Dynamax Pokémon in no time at all![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I am the unbeatable Champion, after all! But what all is going on here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
An overflowing red light... Pokémon Dynamaxing without a Power Spot?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, but why?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m not sure... What’s going on? That red light could suddenly appear again at any time and we’d have no way of knowing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But being able to predict such things is part of a scientist’s work.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Gran?![VAR 0114(000B)]
The chairman called for me. He wanted to know all about the red light’s relationship to the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Did the chairman know anything?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Nothing worth my time. The chairman’s all wrapped up in fretting over the future of our energy, apparently. He’s left everything to that executive lady. We just don’t have enough data.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s why I wanted to ask you to start looking into things, too, Sonia. You know more than anyone about the Darkest Day, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you saying that red light and the Darkest Day are connected?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, do you reckon there’s anything we could do to help out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There must be!
Yeah, we’ll help!
Thanks! I appreciate the thought. But all I could ever ask of you would be that you join me in the greatest final match ever. I’ll do my part to make that happen by keeping everybody’s future safe. So you just keep on doing your part by winning your way through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right. Course! You’re the unbeatable Champion, after all, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gran, there’s something I want to look into. You’ll help me, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naturally.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we all know what we need to do. So, you two—clear the Gym Challenge so we can meet again at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0004)]
I know what I need to do, all right— defeat that Piers once and for all! You’re off to Hammerlocke Stadium, yeah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Raihan’s a tough nut to crack![VAR 0114(0005)]

The long Gym Challenge is nearing its end, I see. Are you ready to face Hammerlocke Gym and its leader, the dragon user Raihan?
You bet I am!
Maybe another time...
You must remember that [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she who dares, wins.
In that case, please use the changing room to change into your uniform.
That uniform you wear is a symbol of all of your victories. I feel your determination. Now, head to where all the Gym Trainers await... No, not the stadium, but the vault!
Ah, one moment! You need at least two battle-ready Pokémon to face Raihan!
The Gym mission, right? Together with your partner, you can’t lose!
That uniform fits you to a tee! Head on in, number [VAR 01C4(0001)]!
Hold on there! If you want to face Raihan, you first need to gather seven Gym Badges. Only then will Raihan even think about letting you face him!

Let’s see, how many Gym Challengers are left? Huh... Not even ten, eh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
All right then. [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Time to explain the great Raihan’s Gym mission![VAR 0114(0017)]
The rules are simple! All you’ve got to do is defeat three Gym Trainers that I personally trained—in Double Battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
The Gym Challenge is meant to be, well... challenging, wouldn’t you say? Naturally there aren’t too many Gym Challengers who can make it this far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And that’s why I provide a format where you can really show off the brilliant combinations you and your Pokémon should be capable of![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s probably more than enough out of me. Time for someone else to take the spotlight! Come on, Sebastian! You’ll be first![VAR 0114(0017)]
Yeah, that’s me. Sebastian. Leader Raihan has taught me two things! First, that Dragon types are ferociously powerful! Second, I need to create an advantage on the battlefield to fully utilize that power!
I can see why you’ve managed to make it this far!
In Double Battles, it’s important to figure out what role each of your opponent’s Pokémon play.
It looks like you don’t have two Pokémon that can battle.
Fantastic! I can see those seven Badges you have were well-earned!
A Double Battle... Do you combine the strength of two Pokémon to push through, or do you have one of them support the other? Let me see what your strategy is!
The Gym mission here requires you to participate in Double Battles. You need to have at least two Pokémon ready for battle...
Well done! I am honored to have battled against such a talented Trainer.
If you manage to beat the Trainer who was beside me, you’ll face me next.
Something the matter, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? You’re not done with my Gym mission yet.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Never mind
I want to withdraw
[~ 18]
Hah! Then hurry up and get it over with! I want to battle you already![VAR 0114(0017)]
Are you sure you want to withdraw?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Fair enough. But you’re not the type to simply give up, right? I’ll be waiting for you to come back soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nice one, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ve completed my Gym mission! Come on. Time to head to the Gym Stadium. You’ve earned the right to face me yourself![VAR 0114(0017)]
Time to face the second Trainer! Come on, Camilla![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve made it to the third and last Trainer! Your moment to shine, Aria![VAR 0114(0017)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text File : 442

Finally, a challenger made it! I’ve been waiting for someone to battle... Though I’ve got to admit I didn’t think it’d be you![VAR 0114(0017)]
But I guess I should’ve expected no less from a Pokémon Trainer that Leon saw promise in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you aim to defeat Leon... Do you have any idea just how high a hurdle that is? As his greatest rival, I guess that I—Raihan—will have to show you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Gym Leader Raihan doesn’t simply control the weather. He also seeks two-on-two battles! You must be prepared for any situation against a foe like him![VAR 0114(0017)]
In the aftermath of the furious battle... I feel as pure and refreshed as when the sky clears after a storm.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What can I possibly say? Calling myself Leon’s rival? Seems I’d grown quite conceited for someone who can’t even claim the title of Champion! Overconfident in both myself and my team![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll give you what you want, then. The proof of your victory—the Dragon Badge![VAR 0114(0017)]
You can now catch Pokémon of any level!
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges from the Galar region![VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, win your way through the Semifinals and Finals for your chance to challenge Leon! You must! You owe us that much at least, for beating us in battle here today![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges... At last it’s time for the Champion Cup! I look forward to seeing how you all do in battle!
Please accept my congratulations on making it through the Gym Challenge!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
Sorry to hold you up, but there was something I forgot.[VAR 0114(0017)]
First off, as a sign of my respect... Here. TM99. It contains the move Breaking Swipe.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And secondly...here’s the Dragon-type Gym uniform, the mark of true strength![VAR 0114(0017)]
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’ve completed the Gym Challenge! Good on you, kid. Now, prove your strength to the whole region at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0017)]
Raihan! I’m here to see just how good you are![VAR 0114(0005)]
There you are, Leon’s little brother! Don’t worry—I’ll give you a battle that’ll make you want to quit the Gym Challenge altogether![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve tried out lots of different strategies, and I’ve made up my mind about how I want to battle. I’m not gonna lose! I’m gonna beat you, and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], and even Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be seeing you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s have another epic battle someday! If you’re feeling up to it, you might want to go train hard in the Wild Area![VAR 0114(0017)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You gave Raihan a good thrashing, and that means you’ve completed the Gym Challenge! Congratulations, from the bottom of my heart![VAR 0114(000B)]
I really wish we could go celebrate, but I think there’re some things we should talk over.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That light that covered Hammerlocke... It was just like the Darkest Day, where it’s said that giant Pokémon went on a rampage and almost destroyed the entire Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It certainly seems to be that way, my dear. As you know, we Dynamax our Pokémon today using the energy from Wishing Stars that have fallen to us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But we still don’t know how to fully control the energy behind Dynamaxing or how the two heroes managed to do so. In fact, we’re not even really sure who—or what— the two heroes actually were.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legendary sword and shield...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia, my dearest... My lab coat is yours now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you sure, Gran? I still haven’t finished the work you’ve assigned me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think of this as something to help you finish that work.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Sonia!
It looks great!
Y-yeah![VAR 0114(000B)]
The two heroes that protected the Galar region from the Darkest Day... And the legend of the sword and shield you just mentioned... It’s up to you to figure out the truth behind it all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know, Gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll do what I can! You or Hop could be the one to take down Leon, and I don’t want to miss that! Not to worry—you can count on me to take care of everything! You just focus on getting to Wyndon. Go on! Head to the station, or you’ll miss your train![VAR 0114(000B)]
The station’s near Route 7, remember? Now, off with you, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]
There are things that only young people like you can do, and there are other things that should be left to the adults. Everyone has their own role.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Wait up, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’m coming, too! I had Raihan beat in no time! Once I got my head on straight and stopped doubting every decision I made, that is... Heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you never stopped nattering on through the entire battle... You’re pretty different from the Champion in that![VAR 0114(0017)]
But your strength is genuine, as proven by the Dragon Badge you won from me. You came at me with all the force of a raging storm, and even I was blown away![VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, you two! Battle your way through the Champion Cup tournament to face Leon! One of you ought to![VAR 0114(0017)]
I reckon I’m still the favorite to win, but I’m up against my true rival, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... So I’ll wring out every last thing I learned during my battle with you, Raihan, to beat h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0005)]
So get a move on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! The train’s waiting![VAR 0114(0005)]

Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Reckon we’ll be able to train ourselves up to new heights here, before the Champion Cup starts?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe in myself and the Pokémon on my team, and I know we’ll all get loads stronger![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I’m off! See you in Wyndon, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], correct? We’ve been watching over your performance in the Gym Challenge. This is just a formality, of course, but I’ll need to check your Gym Badges, if you don’t mind.

First, there are the Semifinals, where you will face the other Trainers who completed the Gym Challenge. If you manage to win in the Semifinals, you will then face the top seven Gym Leaders of the Galar region in the Finals. Defeat them, and you will finally be able to face the Champion in the Championship Match.
The matches will begin shortly. Please ready yourself and head to the pitch.

You again, eh? Well, best of luck to you, kid. Not that it’ll do you a lick of good. Marnie’s sure to win this thing.[VAR 0114(0043)]

So don’t take it personal when I kick your butt![VAR 0114(000D)]
Everyone in the stadium was watchin’ us durin’ all that... I heard them cheerin’ for me and my Pokémon. It was nice...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I may have lost, but... At least we drove the audience wild! Guess that’s not so bad![VAR 0114(000D)]
Think I’ll join my brother in the stands, and we’ll watch from the sidelines to see who ends up challengin’ the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]

When we got our Pokémon from Lee that day, I never would’ve dreamed that I’d end up standing here...facing you, of all people.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s time I finish what was started that day... Got it? The one who’ll become Champion is me![VAR 0114(0005)]
And the victor of the Semifinals, the challenger who has won their way through all of the many hopeful Trainers in the Gym Challenge is... Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
You know, even when Sonia was saying that you and me looked like we could become heroes, I really never felt like one...[VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! That was incredible. Brilliant. Honestly...there were even tears rolling down my face before I knew it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
To think that the two of you set out together from the same town, built up the greatest teams, and arrived here at this point to throw everything you had at one another...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That burning desire to win... Those moves filled with undefeatable passion! It was battling at its very purest, in every possible way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even though there were some Trainers who weren’t sure whether you were fit to be endorsed for the Gym Challenge at first...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That was you, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well then, all the more reason! My team members and I will give everything that we’ve got in us to defeat our challenger.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And the challenger standing before us might well end up being you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. In fact, that’s precisely what I’m hoping for![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! The real challenge is what’s coming next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m completely exhausted! I just want to head back to the hotel and rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Best to refill your energy stores first! Why don’t we go get some dinner together?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wouldn’t say no, but... you never care at all what food tastes like, Lee! A night like this deserves more than rubbish takeaway, so at least pick something good![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hey, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Got some time for questions?!
First question! You and Challenger Hop were both endorsed by the Champion, making the two of you rivals in a sense, wouldn’t you say? How does it feel to have defeated your rival?
I’m glad I could beat him
It doesn’t quite feel real yet
It was just luck that I won
Right... Question number two! If you wanted to tell Challenger Hop something right now, what would it be?
I’d thank him for the great match!
I’d tell him how strong he was
That he was just the rival I knew he was
Question three! Level with me, kiddo. Your honest thoughts here. Think you can win the Finals, too?
I absolutely do
I’m not sure...
I doubt it, really...
All right—that’s enough! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s already tired from battle! And you’ve been asking rather rude questions![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got ourselves dinner plans with my brother, so, sorry, but clear off already, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, yes, I understand! Looking forward to seeing the birth of a new star!
Phew... Famous people sure have it rough, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope Lee gets here soon. I could eat my own arm about now.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Several hours later...
This is absurd... Even Lee’s never this late. Something’s not right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He always does what he says he’ll do. As a kid, he promised me he’d become Champion one day, and he went and did just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
He ought to be able to keep to his own dinner plans![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kid’s sure got a mouth on him, huh? If you were that noisy durin’ battle, you’d unleash a whole new level of power, you know.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, pack it in, Piers! I’m seriously worried here! So I don’t need to see your smug mug looking like you’re having a go at me, even though you act like you’re giving me good advice![VAR 0114(0005)]
Judgin’ by appearances? No wonder you lost to your mate.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Champion, I saw him headin’ to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Why would he go there?
Rose Tower?
Dunno what he’s up to, but I ran into him at the monorail platform. He said to tell you that he had somethin’ to do at Rose Tower, so he’d be late to your dinner.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But why Rose Tower? What could he have to do there at this hour?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers, do us a favor. Take us to Rose Tower, would you? Neither [VAR TRNAME(0000)] nor I know the way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheesh... What rude siblings, always so demandin’ of others.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Though I s’ppose... It’s a real problem for me, too, if the Finals are held up for any reason. And I don’t really hate the two of you little runts. You were good enough to beat me, after all.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So I think I’ll invite Team Yell along, and we’ll all have ourselves a bit of fun. Shall we?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Brilliant! You’re the best, Piers! Let’s go make a real ruckus![VAR 0114(0005)]

Man, why am I here for this? I’m totally exhausted from that battle with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000D)]
We decided that Team Yell will cheer you on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Let’s help out together.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What a beautiful display of sibling love! However, it is entirely unnecessary.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Oleana?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Chairman Rose is with the Champion in a very, very important meeting...[VAR 0114(0007)]
There is no way I will let anyone interfere![VAR 0114(0007)]
After all, only authorized personnel with the proper key can ride the monorail to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That means as long as Chairman Rose is in the tower, no one can disturb him![VAR 0114(0007)]
I have hand selected a member of the League staff and given them a key. Chairman Rose does enjoy these kind of menial games after all.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can tell the difference between normal League staff and the one I chose?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can find me?
What should we do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Tch. This isn’t good! But I got this one![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Team Yell’s yellin’ will handle this![VAR 0114(0016)]
No. This is brilliant! I’ll search around the front of the stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
For now, we should try to head to the plaza together, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, let’s all work together and head for Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hmm. You should be able to get to the plaza yourself, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]

Let’s find Oleana’s League staff member. That bad one was wearin’ those lame shades, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That bad League staff member was wearin’ some awful shades. And the key to findin’ anyone is to just ask everyone you meet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like nobody’s seen that bad League staff member anywhere else. I bet they’re hidin’ somewhere nearby.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Makes sense for a cornered person to seek out the tightest hidin’ place, I guess. Don’t s’ppose you got a box lyin’ around?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Guess that wraps up Oleana’s little game. Course, I’m not one to talk, I guess. Team Yell did their fair share of lame tricks... Anyway, let’s head to the station.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! This bloke’s awfully shifty, but I can’t get him to turn around! Say somethin’ surprisin’ so that he’ll have no choice but to look this way!
Ms. Oleana’s here!
We already have the key, you know
What?!
Blast, I turned around! And I can’t escape?! In that case, time for a Pokémon battle!
All I need to do is hide, and I won’t have to give you the key!
It’s a wonder how fast that guy could run... I’ve got no idea where he went, guv.
How’d you find me...? Or did you just talk to everyone you met?! Bah, whatever! I’ll defeat you this time!
They say hide a tree in a forest, so... I thought I could hide myself in the crowd!
You’re way too observant! But I’ll win this time and make my getaway!
Seems like you’ve got me cornered... But I’m not going to give up! An earful from Ms. Oleana is way worse than anything you lot can do! Good luck catching me on the monorail!
Team Yell, go find Hop! We’ll corner that League staff member at the station together![VAR 0114(0016)]
You did a crackin’ job of cornerin’ that bad League staff member, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Let me sing you a song fittin’ of your rockin’ deeds![VAR 0114(0016)]
The only thing a humble singer can do is sing a humble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe I can’t cheer someone on just with the tunes I play. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe my songs don’t make anyone happy. Maybe I can’t help. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still the only thing I can do is sing—sing my humble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Piers!
Go Pieeerrrs!
Hey, isn’t that Piers? Why’s he doing a street performance?
I think you mean a station performance. Come on—let’s see if we can get closer!
We got the key, Piers! We can take the monorail to Rose Tower now!
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hop! Now’s your chance! Go! Get outta here![VAR 0114(0016)]

So this is Rose Tower! Just how tall do you think it is? I can’t even see the top, up there in the clouds.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what should we do? Team Yell is gonna have their hands full holdin’ up those bad League staff members. They won’t be catchin’ up anytime soon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yeah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. What should we do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go ahead!
Wait for the others to catch up?
Good thinking! Let’s go collect Lee and get out of here! Without him, there’s no Champion for you to challenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0005)]
’Fraid I can’t agree to that, mate. Team Yell’s giving it their all to help us out so we can go ahead and help Lee.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], you cleared the way to Rose Tower. Now all you gotta do is charge on ahead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
An employee’s an employee I guess... Seems that exec lady hid the monorail key to try and impress the chairman.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Chairman Rose’s been keepin’ the Champion holed up inside. Wonder what he’s plottin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 10]
Times like this—when tension and passion run high—remind me of Spikemuth in the old days. Some right wild concerts we had back then. But no encores![VAR 0114(0016)]
Wait, you’re still here?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You better get goin’! I’ll send some support your way with a yell![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Gotta stick around to make sure my bro doesn’t do anythin’ too crazy, right? Come back if you need anythin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Whoa, it’s huge in here! What in the world is this place meant to be?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Don’t know if you knew this already, but I’ve heard Rose Tower was built on a Power Spot. Yeah, you know what I’m saying... When we get up to the roof and have a bit of space, we can Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Which is all well and good. But less certain is whether this lift can get us to the top...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower has, like, a hundred floors, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be leaving right now, so there’s no need to worry about the lift!
Intruder alert. Intruder alert. All staff are ordered to help remove the intruders from the premises at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See? If Ms. Oleana says so, then it looks like this is the end of the line for you kids.
If I get rid of the intruders, I’ll probably get a big bonus!
M-my bonus... My dream of finally affording a house of my own...
We need to speak with Chairman Rose! Tell us where he is![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get on the lift. The chairman’s at the top of the building.
All right! We’re nearly to Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Lee! We’re coming![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s crack on![VAR 0114(0005)]

This is taking ages...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? I don’t think we’re at the roof yet... Why have we stopped?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are Gym Challengers, aren’t you? Thank you for taking part in the Galar League’s Gym Challenge! Yet I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to interfere in our work. We will drive you out to protect the many subsidiary companies housed here in Rose Tower!
Behold the gloriously high-tech elevators of Rose Tower, able to withstand Pokémon battles! They are constructed by the subsidiary Macro Cosmos Construction!
If I’ve been defeated, I have little choice but to respectfully retreat. Yet I must ask once more that you please do not interfere with Chairman Rose’s work.
The elevators in Rose Tower are constructed so that only the floor ascends. But that presents some danger, thus the presence of these walls constructed of light. You can thank Macro Cosmos Construction for providing this wonderful technology as well.
Wait... So the folks working in the tower can stop the elevator from the outside at any time? We’re just trying to get to the top already![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our teams have been working themselves ragged for us. Let me heal them all up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower is almost a thousand feet tall! You are now about five hundred feet above the ground!
I’m from MC Insurance! Do you have a life insurance policy?
I’m quite terrified of heights, actually...
Unfortunately, our insurance doesn’t pay out for being defeated in Pokémon battles...
You’re nearly to the top! But you’ll not be meeting the chairman!
I’ve got no fear of heights! I work high in the skies doing my job for the lofty Macro Cosmos Air!
Don’t you presume to meet the chairman! You’re not on the same level as such a great man!
You must know that in high-rises such as this one, the higher up you go, the more important the people you find working there. Chairman Rose is at the top of the top! Not just of this tower, but of all Galar!
Looks as though we’re nearly there, mate... Look sharp! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome to Chairman Rose’s exclusive space. Here, nearly a thousand feet above the earth![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, you got through all of the special staff that I had ordered to stop you. I would expect nothing less of the Trainers handpicked by Champion Leon himself.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But I am afraid it is now time for you to go home.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Because...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I will not allow anyone to disturb the great Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
You shall be the first, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! If I beat you to pieces, then the Champion will have no one to battle and will thus lose heart. In that state, he will listen to anything the chairman says![VAR 0114(0007)]
Arghhh! This is inexcusable... What was I thinking... Any Gym Challenger who’s made it this far would be no pushover...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Under normal circumstances, I would have tried to delay you further. However, all the necessary Wishing Stars have been collected. Do as you wish. There is nothing to be done now.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Typical [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are unstoppable![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Stay on guard...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Everything I did, I did to further the chairman’s own goals...[VAR 0114(0007)]

ROSE: Leon. We’ve discussed this a hundred times already. And still you fail to understand what’s at stake? You, who is supposed to be our Champion...[VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: I think I understand well enough.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What I don’t understand is why we ought to cancel tomorrow’s tournament in order to solve a problem that’s a thousand years away from affecting any of us! What difference is one day going to make?[VAR 0114(0004)]
My duty as Champion isn’t this...this madness. It’s to carry out that Championship Match! That’s what Galar wants—and what I want! It’s what we’ve all been looking forward to for so long![VAR 0114(0004)]
ROSE: No, you don’t understand... You still don’t understand a thing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Look around us, Leon! Look at the Galar region stretched out before us. And know that the energy required to keep this brilliant, glittering world alive will be exhausted a millennium from now! The people of Galar today will no longer even exist. What Galar wants today hardly matters![VAR 0114(0006)]
The future is more important than just one day! We must act as quickly as we possibly can! We must take action in order to avert tragedy! So that all can look forward to a better future![VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: In a thousand years! Fine. Look. I think I understand your concerns, Chairman. And I give my word I’ll help you with your plans... just as soon as tomorrow’s match is over.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee... You never showed when you were supposed to, so I got worried that something had happened... Piers and Marnie and all those Team Yell oddballs, they all helped us out to get here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I must apologize to you, Hop, if we’ve made you worry at all. There are times when adults just can’t seem to have an honest discussion with one another. Sometimes our pride just gets in the way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Never mind any of this, Hop, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Let’s head back to the hotel, and we’ll all grab dinner together, yeah? It’s on me, so you can order whatever you fancy.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’ll excuse us, Chairman Rose... And I do hope you’ll watch tomorrow’s match. It’s sure to be one for the history books.[VAR 0114(0004)]
One for the history books... You still don’t understand, young Champion... We... No, I am going to change the course of history![VAR 0114(0006)]

Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? The Finals will be starting shortly. I’m here to escort you to the stadium.
What’s all this! Didn’t learn your lesson yesterday?! If you need another helping of Hop and his trusty [VAR PKNAME(0001)], I’ll be happy to give you one![VAR 0114(0005)]
No! Wait, please! I’m not like those other League staff! I’m a good one! If I may say so myself...
I heard about what happened yesterday. Ms. Oleana can be a little extreme in her desire to assist the chairman with his goals, I’m afraid.
It seems she was cultivating her own group of League staff in secret to be deployed for... well...things like that debacle last night.
But you’ve no need to worry about today’s staff! All of us are here for the right reasons.
Well, that’s what she says... I guess we trust her, then, yeah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Let’s go! I can’t wait another minute![VAR 0114(0005)]
Would you like me to show you the way to Wyndon Stadium?
Then let’s be on our way!

Whoever makes it through this final bracket will win the right to challenge the Champion... So, are you ready to go to the locker room now?
Yes, straightaway

Then in you go!
Would you like to speak with the others for one last spot of advice?
I’ll always press on and challenge myself so that I can go on as a Pokémon Trainer for as long as possible. As long as you continue to push yourself, your brilliance will never fade.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My first match is against Raihan of all people? What rotten luck... But even if he changes the weather around, I don’t plan on throwing in the towel so easy.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Long time no see! This’ll be a different sort of battle than you faced in the Gym Challenge. Those were basically test matches, but this... This is serious battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s a curious feeling... My heart is racing a bit, but I still can’t wait for the match to begin![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll be bringing my matches to an end in a heartbeat—you’ll see. No one who sees them will ever forget me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m going to win my way through every round, then I’ll be the one taking on Leon! If I don’t, then I’ll have failed to repay Duraludon and the rest of my team for all their hard work![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say I aim to win this thing... And I’ll do it without usin’ Dynamax, to help everyone in Spikemuth reclaim their pride... and to see ’em smile once again.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The opening ceremony will begin momentarily. Please head to the pitch at once.

Wait, you![VAR 0114(0042)]
Who’s that?[VAR 0114(006B)]
A moment, if I may. Does anyone here even remember me? I am Bede, the challenger who was forced to withdraw from the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede! He’s the challenger endorsed by Chairman Rose himself![VAR 0114(006B)]
I have a score to settle with Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here. I’m aware that this is against the rules, but I must ask nonetheless... Let me battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer! I’ll stake my career as a challenger on this battle. If I lose, I’ll retire from being a Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What an unexpected turn of events! Former Challenger Bede has come for one last battle![VAR 0114(0018)]
We are currently debating what to do with Challenger Bede. To all our viewers, both here in the stadium and at home in front of the telly, we ask that you please be patient![VAR 0114(0018)]
I know this is ridiculous of me. But I had to say something...do something![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ever since you showed up, everything I’ve done has gone wrong! It was Oleana who asked me to gather Wishing Stars for the chairman, but then the chairman himself disowned me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And then that strange old lady comes out of nowhere and drags me into a boot camp on Fairy-type Pokémon! Do you have any idea what I’ve been through?! Covered in pink, dealing with quizzes and battles with Fairy-type Pokémon every day![VAR 0114(000C)]
And here I am, pouring my heart out to you... when I’ve never lost my cool before![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve reached a decision, ladies and gentlemen! The Champion himself has accepted Bede’s sudden interruption! Is the Champion showing his love...by giving every Trainer a chance to grow stronger? Or is it a trial for Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
My will hasn’t been broken yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I lost...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It looks like Challenger Bede was no match for Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser trusted team![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Bede! That was some match![VAR 0114(006B)]
Don’t retire! Just restart your career![VAR 0114(006B)]
B-but this isn’t what I planned! If I was able to defeat you, then everything would be fine. Even if I lost, I was going to use retiring as an excuse to get away from that old lady![VAR 0114(000C)]
You just keep messing up my plans! With everyone cheering me on like this, I have no choice but to continue my training as the Fairy-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000C)]
Though I suppose with my talents, I’ll be able to overtake Ms. Opal in no time.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The stadium is filled with voices cheering on these two young Trainers! Now, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)], please head back to the locker room so that you can rest up from that unexpected match...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Rather surprising for Challenger Bede to barge in like that... In any case, once you’re ready, please head onto the pitch. The Finals are about to begin.

The time for waiting is over! The Finals of the Champion Cup are about to begin! The two Trainers to face each other in the first battle of the first round are...[VAR 0114(0018)]
A Trainer endorsed by the Champion himself, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
H[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser opponent is... the raging wave! The master of Water types, Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
I can tell you’ve grown far stronger since you faced me in Hulbury Stadium. I’ve got to hand it to our undefeated Champion. He’s got a proper eye for talent, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
But you’re not the Champion, and you’ll never become the Champion, either. Do you know why? It’s because I, Nessa, am going to defeat both you and Leon![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m not going to underestimate you again. I’ll use Dynamax to wash you out to sea and beyond the horizon![VAR 0114(000F)]
Aaaaaand the winner is...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated Nessa during the Gym Challenge and now has pulled it off again![VAR 0114(0018)]
You and your Pokémon are just too much... Even with my Dynamaxed partner, you weathered our waves and stood firm.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Now that I think about it, Sonia was saying something about how amazing you were. I wish I’d paid more attention to what she was talking about.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I bet everyone in Galar’s got their eyes on you now. You defeated my team, so now you’ve got to ride that current all the way to the end![VAR 0114(000F)]
Now...don’t go anywhere, ladies and gentlemen! The second battle of the first round will begin shortly![VAR 0114(0018)]

Ladies and gentlemen, we’re already at the second match of the Finals! Of the four remaining challengers, which two will be left for the last match?![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you’re just tuning in, ladies and gentlemen, we witnessed quite the surprise during the Finals here at this year’s Champion Cup, as the former Gym Challenger Bede stormed the stage! But [VAR TRNAME(0000)] was having none of it! This year’s top challenger made quick work of him before washing away Gym Leader Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
On the other side, we have... the Galar karate prodigy! Let’s hear it for Gym Leader Bea, everybody![VAR 0114(0018)]
I promise you, my attacks will shake your very soul this time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
May the best Trainer win.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Bea has been defeated! Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has shown h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser skill![VAR 0114(0018)]
Thank you for a wonderful match.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I really enjoyed battling you and your team... I’m upset that I lost, but I also feel so satisfied and so refreshed...[VAR 0114(0011)]
In a way, I guess you could say it was the best sort of match anyone could ever hope for.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The next match will begin in no time, so stay in those seats, folks![VAR 0114(0018)]

And now to take h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer on, here comes Gym Leader Allister—the boy known far and wide as the silent school-aged star![VAR 0114(0018)]
...’M Allister. ...You look well.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I remember you... You were the strongest Gym Challenger I had. Er...so I reckon...we sh-should battle![VAR 0114(0012)]
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has done it again! What a performance! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe sails right through![VAR 0114(0018)]
Crumbs...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...That was ace.[VAR 0114(0012)]
G-give it your best out there. I’m mad about strong Trainers...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Our seemingly unstoppable challenger is headed for the final round, but who will [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she meet there? Will it be I-Pass-on-Dynamaxing Piers? Or the Dragon Lord himself—Raihan? The next match will decide it, so don’t go far from your screens![VAR 0114(0018)]

I thought my bro could get revenge for me, but he lost to Raihan.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You looked so sloppy out there that people are gonna think we’re both weak ’cause we’re related![VAR 0114(000D)]
You got it wrong, Sis. Raihan’s just that strong. But I was able to show everyone in the audience how amazin’ a proper battle without usin’ Dynamax can be.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, I get it! But that’s exactly why I wanted you to win! I still thought it was a brilliant battle, though...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m countin’ on you to win, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Got that? I’ll be cheerin’ for you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sorry to come in for a chin-wag just before the final match. Raihan’s waiting for you on the pitch. We’re lookin’ forward to a right good battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]

Here it is, the last match of the Finals! Who will earn the right to challenge the unbeatable Champion Leon?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Will it be the brilliant rising star, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Or will it be the only Trainer that Champion Leon calls his rival... the tamer of dragons, Raihan?![VAR 0114(0018)]
You’re really something else, kid. You’ve made it all the way here! I guess that’s why the Champion himself endorsed you, yeah?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Leon’s my rival—and he chose you. So I’ve got to first prove I’m better than you if I’m to beat him! I’ve reworked my whole team, and now we’re all geared up for one-on-one battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
You might be thinking that you beat me once already... But if you think I’m the same Raihan you faced during the Gym Challenge, you’ll soon regret it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] seizes victory![VAR 0114(0018)]
My lovely Pokémon and I have become much stronger than we were before... But you just blew right past us! Beyond anything I’d imagined![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m still pretty young myself, but it just goes to show that there’s always someone younger coming up, reaching further than you ever dreamed... And you’ve got your whole future ahead of you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Keep up the momentum! Prove that Leon’s not unbeatable![VAR 0114(0017)]
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)], has achieved a dazzling triumph! The Trainer who was endorsed by the Champion will now face the very man who endorsed h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0018)]

Still, it’s not easy picking sides...[VAR 0114(0005)]

But remember, the audience is also a bit cruel... They want nothing more than to see one of us lose, after all![VAR 0114(0004)]
It can fill you with fear knowing that, but I absolutely love pushing past the fear. I love giving it everything I’ve got as a Trainer and seeing my team give everything they’ve got to seize another victory! It’s the greatest feeling in the world, and I can’t get enough of it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can feel my partners itching with anticipation inside their Poké Balls... We’re going to have a real champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the Galar region’s Champion, Leon! Me and Charizard, and all the rest of our team, will use all our knowledge and experience to crush you completely![VAR 0114(0004)]

Lee! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That video stream... That was from Hammerlocke Stadium, right? What in the world did the chairman do...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know! But everything he was saying yesterday... Did he really pull this crazy stunt to solve some problem a thousand years in the future?! I’ve got to go see what’s going on... I’m the Champion! I have to go![VAR 0114(0004)]
I should’ve realized what the chairman intended to do before it came to this... I’ll take responsibility now for fixing this mess![VAR 0114(0004)]
This is the real Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
But, Lee! You’re terrible at directions... What if you get lost along the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I want to help my brother, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ve got to! But I can’t even manage to beat you, so what sort of help could I ever be...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You can help!
Just try!
Easy for you to say...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But what? What can I even do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold the phone... The chairman was talking about the Darkest Day. That’s that thing where the sky went all dark once, ages and ages ago, right? What does he mean, he’s bringing that about? And where did we even hear that name...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in Motostoke
That statue of the hero...
That statue of the hero in Motostoke! Sonia said something back then, didn’t she... Though it turned out to be wrong, since there were actually two heroes and all that. Still! Those two managed to bring an end to the Darkest Day with the sword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia thought the Pokémon might still be sleeping somewhere though, right? We should try to find them, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! But where to start looking...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in the Slumbering Weald?
Back home in Postwick?
Maybe in Circhester?
You sure about that? I dunno... Doesn’t feel right to me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’m sure it’s got to be the Slumbering Weald! That illusion you tried to fight off that day— it must’ve been one of the Pokémon that are supposed to be sleeping there![VAR 0114(0005)]

Haven’t you been watching the news at all? The tournament is off, Sonia! The chairman saw to that—and to sending the entire region into a state of havoc![VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh? What?! What happened while I was researching things in the Slumbering Weald?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, for starters, there’s a great black storm or something raging over Hammerlocke Stadium. What’re they calling it? “The Darkest Day”? It’s thrown everything into disarray![VAR 0114(0008)]
Still, I’m sure we don’t need to worry too much... The unbeatable Champion will be able to take care of everything, won’t he?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on a tick, ma’am. Did you say “the Darkest Day”?[VAR 0114(000B)]
“The Darkest Day” is the name for the black storm that nearly brought the Galar region to ruin in ancient times...[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what’re you here for, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m here to stop the Darkest Day!
To search for the sword Pokémon
To search for the shield Pokémon
To stop the Darkest Day... You mean you’re going to search for the sword and shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose if the legends are true, then the sword and shield Pokémon should be able to prevent the Darkest Day from coming to pass... They may be just what we need to beat back the black storm![VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Here, take this. You should head to the Slumbering Weald. I’ll catch up with you once I’m done looking into something that’s been bothering me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got to keep looking into the origin of the sword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]

Going into the forest after Wooloo that day... That was the start of everything, wasn’t it? A legendary beginning, really...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hop, you sure you haven’t lost the plot? There was no one here but the two of you...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha... Then were those just...illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen! I dug into some literature from other regions, and I finally found something! Mentions of the sword Pokémon, Zacian, and the shield Pokémon, called Zamazenta. The writings said that those two Pokémon were born somewhere beyond the Slumbering Weald sometime long, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Did they really? Ta, Sonia. Thanks for digging into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even if it is just an illusion or whatever, we did manage to find that Pokémon again... Maybe the sword and the shield that those two used to carry are still here, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zacian and Zamazenta... They may have been sleeping in the Slumbering Weald right next to your hometown all this time. Perhaps that’s why no one has entered the deepest parts of these woods for so long...[VAR 0114(000B)]

If anybody’s gonna help Lee now, I guess it’s just you and me, mate! He’s probably still at Hammerlocke Stadium, trying to keep the Darkest Day at bay. So what d’you say, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Wanna grab a Flying Taxi to head right there?[VAR 0114(0005)]

And Chairman Rose thinking that the energy pouring from the Darkest Day would somehow be the key to saving Galar’s future? It all seems a bit mad, if you ask me... I can’t follow at all how that’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, I don’t care if I’m up against the Darkest Day or the chairman or whatever! I’m going ahead! I’m off to help my brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And he’s gone... That Hop never changes. Always in a rush about something, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0017)]
The key thing is that no one’s been harmed. We Gym Leaders worked together with the city’s Pokémon, and we’ve got everyone evacuated.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you, you’re fixing to help our Champion? To save everyone in the Galar region?[VAR 0114(0017)]

Mr. Rose has awakened a Pokémon known as Eternatus... Apparently, the energy emitted from its body is what causes Dynamaxing.[VAR 0114(0007)]
At this rate, all the Pokémon in the Galar region will Dynamax and go berserk! If that were to happen—[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please, you must save Mr. Rose! You can take the lift over there to reach him. I’ve enlisted the help of the Champion’s younger brother, too, but who knows what is going on...[VAR 0114(0007)]

Uh, pardon? What are you talking about? There’s nothing to stop now. We’ve already brought about the Darkest Day...or should I say, the ultimate Pokémon—Eternatus![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m afraid I can’t allow that. The Champion is the one who needs to control Eternatus.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Must I explain myself? From your perspective, I suppose it must seem that I am doing something terrible. I don’t expect you to understand. But I must provide the Galar region with limitless energy to ensure everlasting prosperity. It is my purpose, my duty, my destiny![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why we’ve been giving the Wishing Stars to Eternatus! Surely you remember the red light that caused a ruckus around Hammerlocke. That was all part of our experiments to awaken Eternatus! You must understand. I can’t let you interfere with my plan to protect the future of Galar![VAR 0114(0006)]

Most impressive, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I wouldn’t expect any less from a challenger endorsed by the strongest Champion ever to grace our beloved Galar region![VAR 0114(0006)]
I really do wish I could have seen the Championship Match between you two. And I’m terribly sorry to have ruined the whole Gym Challenge and everything![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped... In order to solve the energy issue as soon as possible, we awakened Eternatus. But we couldn’t control it. The Champion came to aid me, even at the cost of abandoning the match.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed, just like a knight in shining armor coming to rescue a princess from a dragon![VAR 0114(0006)]
I do tend to ramble on, I know. I love to make speeches. But I think I can stop talking now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think the Champion should have captured Eternatus by now. If you’re curious, you can take the lift up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I trust you’ll be going too, right, Hop? I certainly hope losing to me didn’t discourage you too much. Go on now, both of you! Go see how our Champion is doing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Discouraged...? You don’t get it, do you, Chairman? Neither me nor my Pokémon are anywhere near giving up! We’ve learned how to be strong, thanks to the Gym Challenge you organized![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I’m ready for anything. Are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
Give me a moment
Wouldn’t expect any less from my rival! Now, come on! We’ve got to help Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, we’ve no idea what’s going on up there. Better be sure you’re really ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I won’t stop you. Head up via the lift, if you wish![VAR 0114(0006)]

You came to help me in spite of the danger? Thanks, Hop. And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You two really have grown tremendously![VAR 0114(0004)]
But no need for you kids to worry. It seems like some power of Eternatus’s was keeping my team from Dynamaxing, but... we’ve had a champion time all the same![VAR 0114(0004)]
Charizard and the rest of my champion team members have really worn Eternatus down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now if I can simply catch it in a Poké Ball, we should be able to get this madness under control. Then everything will be back to normal. So watch this! It’s going to be a real champion catch![VAR 0114(0004)]

Three days later...
So, Chairman Rose turned himself in, then? Never thought I’d live to see the day...
He awoke Eternatus and nearly caused a catastrophe for the entire region! You reap what you sow, I say.
I don’t know about you, but I slept like the dead![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everyone’s still talking about what happened, but at least things are back to normal now. We really did defeat Eternatus together with Zamazenta and Zacian![VAR 0114(0005)]
And still Lee’s...well, he’s being Lee. Insisting on having a Championship Match with you today. It’s a bit much, isn’t it? You sure you’re up for it? I’m not even too sure about him. He was out cold and hurt pretty badly himself during all that mess.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand how he feels, though. Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to get to see you and him face off in a serious match.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So come on! The match’ll be at Wyndon Stadium. Where else![VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s time for the match. Please head to the pitch.
The Champion is waiting for you to challenge him anytime. Would you like to go to the locker room?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 584
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the final match against the Champion. The Championship Match! Are you ready to face Leon?
I’m ready to beat him!
I still need to get ready
Then change into your uniform, and head out onto the pitch!
There’s no turning back now!
My matches are always sold out, but this... I’ve never seen a crowd this wild![VAR 0114(0004)]
Everyone knows what you did for us this week, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... They know you’re the one who caught Eternatus and saved the future of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A real hero, who battled alongside the Legendary Pokémon, Zacian and Zamazenta... I couldn’t have dreamed of a better challenger to help increase my winning streak![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh... And you’ve even added Eternatus to your party. The greatest challenger along with the most powerful Pokémon—is that it? Now you’re really getting me excited![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that I’ve seen just what kind of strength you possess as the greatest of challengers... crushing you into the dirt will show everyone just how strong their Champion truly is![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s make this a final match that’ll go down in Galar’s history! No! A match that’ll change Galar forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re gonna have an absolutely champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]?! What’re you doing here in the woods?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you?
The truth is...
Nobody ever comes in here, since this is the forest where Zacian and Zamazenta rested. It’s the best place to do a bit of thinking, since it’s so quiet and all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? That’s... Mate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you here? That’s... Mate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve been thinking, you know... Maybe the reason Zacian and Zamazenta chose a place like this to sleep was because no one ever comes here and it’s so quiet all the time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, but I hadn’t had the chance to tell you! Congrats on your victory, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Honestly, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... I never thought you’d manage to beat my brother. The greatest Champion Galar ever had! He was undefeatable till you came around![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s actually still pretty hard to believe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Really... You’re amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
So amazing, maybe, that I don’t even realize just how amazing you really are![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 12]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], do you think... Would you be up for one more battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sure!
Why?
Thanks, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Then show me the strength that defeated Lee, the greatest Champion we ever had![VAR 0114(0005)]
Because I want to feel for myself the strength that defeated my brother, the greatest Champion we’d ever had... Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m ready when you are, so just say the word![VAR 0114(0005)]

This’ll be a serious battle! You’re ready for that, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
Wait a minute...
So, the Champion thinks [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she can make me wait, is that it? Come on! Let’s have a battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, there really is no way I could ever beat you... I mean, you even beat my “unbeatable” brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And if it isn’t the two of you again. I was wondering what all the noise was about.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Congratulations on beating Leon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you
It was nothing...
Taking it all in stride like it’s your due, eh? You cheeky thing![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, trying to act modest, are you? Go on—you’ve earned the right to be proud![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be off assisting the professor?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, I’m actually not working as my gran’s assistant any longer...[VAR 0114(000B)]
In fact... I’m the professor now![VAR 0114(000B)]
Y-you are?![VAR 0114(0005)]
And really, I’ve got the two of you to thank for that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I was just along for the ride on your adventure, but I ended up taking a real interest in the history of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And I came to care for Pokémon even more than I ever had before![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah, here! It’s a book I wrote! I even signed it—that makes it a collector’s item.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You received a copy of Sonia’s Book!
[~ 25]
[~ 26]
I’ve already got my own copy. Lined up to buy it on the day it came out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Aww, thanks, Hop! That’s so sweet. I’ll sign your copy for you later.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, I’ve got my gran’s blessing and put out my first book under my own name... I think you can expect great things of the lovely Professor Sonia in the future, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I expect so... Sonia and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you both amaze me! I’ve got a lot to live up to here![VAR 0114(0005)]
So? What are you young’ns doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, oh, right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ohhh... That’s it, isn’t it? You were putting the Rusted Sword and the Rusted Shield back in their place?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t just keep holding on to them forever, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We...were! Yeah, that’s what we were doing! We were just about to do that.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You forgot entirely, didn’t you? What, you think the two of you are besties now with Zacian and Zamazenta or something?![VAR 0114(000B)]
That must be it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Why you felt like you were called here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s put the sword and the shield back and say a proper thanks for all the help. Maybe if we do, we’ll get to see Zacian and Zamazenta again someday.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have the best memories of the Slumbering Weald, but I came to do a quick investigation. Hurry it up, and put the Rusted Sword and the Rusted Shield back where they belong! I’d like to get a photo of them on location.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Return the [VAR ITEM2(0001)]?
Zacian! Zamazenta! Thanks loads for helping us out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Took us a little while, but we’ve brought back your precious relics and all![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and Hop returned the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield!
All right! That about settles that. [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], why don’t you and I head back?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you gonna do, Sonia?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I’ll stay here a bit longer. I want to do a little more research here in the forest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? My Power Spot Detector is going off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well... I thought I heard someone making some noise over this way![VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, well, well... You wouldn’t be the Professor Sonia who wrote the book “Galar: A History”?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Eh, ah, hello... You bought my book?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why yes, of course! Read it from cover to cover![VAR 0114(0042)]
Why yes, of course! I even wrote an internet review for it![VAR 0114(0042)]
That awful book was filled with lies... So we gave it one star![VAR 0114(006A)]
What?! There are no lies printed in that book![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s just plain rude![VAR 0114(0005)]
I am Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
I am Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
We are the new kings of Galar! We’re descendants of the first kings![VAR 0114(0068)]
More than that, we’re celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
New kings? Descendants? Seriously, what are you on about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What exactly are you two supposed to be?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well! Could these things here be the fabled sword and shield?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well! They certainly are dirty! They must be fake! I fear to touch them with my bare hands.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sordward took the Rusted Sword!
Shielbert took the Rusted Shield!
Hey! Don’t go nicking those! We just returned them![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, do shut up! We only happened to pick up some things that were dropped on the ground![VAR 0114(0068)]
If you’ve got a problem with it, how about you prove to whom they belong, hmm?[VAR 0114(0069)]
But...there’s no way anyone can prove who those ancient things belong to! Even if we can’t prove it, they’re really important to Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh goodness. Such a plebeian, and yet so pushy. If it’s really so important to you, perhaps we should settle this with a battle?[VAR 0114(0068)]
We’re celebrities who buy battles for twice what they’re worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
What does that even mean...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I, the magnificent Sordward, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0068)]
I, the magnificent Shielbert, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0069)]
You took back the [VAR ITEM2(0001)]!
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable Pokémon I go strolling with... You’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable Pokémon I go strolling with... You’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0069)]
However, it appears that my younger brother was victorious.[VAR 0114(0068)]
However, it appears that my older brother was victorious.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sorry, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... I lost to him...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy? You weren’t concentrating at all during our battle![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy? You weren’t concentrating at all during our battle![VAR 0114(0068)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Older Brother! Isn’t that the one who stopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Younger Brother! Isn’t that the one who stopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is! What a rude child, snatching up our chance at glory like that.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is! What a rude child, snatching up our chance at glory like that.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources... I believe [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the destruction of the magnificent mural our ancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources... I believe [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the destruction of the magnificent mural our ancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our family has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our family has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0069)]
Mural? You mean the one that hid the historical ruins of [VAR PKNAME(0001)] and the others? And hold on a moment—[VAR TRNAME(0000)] wasn’t the one who destroyed it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall bring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0069)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall bring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0068)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes, let’s do that![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
W-wait! Stop! Give back that [VAR ITEM2(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ugh, that kid. He’s gone and recklessly run off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
At least you’re calm, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I expected as much.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m surprised that Hop lost to someone like that. He looked upset about something during the battle. Maybe that had something to do with it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
His own rival became the new Champion, and his goal vanished before his eyes... You can’t help but wonder how he feels about it all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway! Sordward and Shielbert, was it? I think I might know something about where those two weirdos went...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Shall we go over it at the lab in Wedgehurst?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Of course!
I’m worried about Hop
I bet I didn’t even need to ask! Thanks![VAR 0114(000B)]
I get it... You feel responsible for him and want to help him as soon as you can, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, we’ll meet up later, then! I’ll head back to the lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hm?
Professor Sonia, you have a visitor.
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Glad you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Who’s this?
You got an assistant?
She’s my assistant! I’ve been so busy with research lately that I’ve had to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Spot on! I’ve been busy with my research, so I decided to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been keeping all the Wishing Stars that Chairman Rose had been gathering here in the lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Things have been a little hectic around here, but my assistant has been handling things in a proper fashion. She’s really been helping me keep things afloat.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I really haven’t been doing all that much...
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], the Champion, right? I’m really glad I get to meet you. It’s an honor, truly.
Come here for a moment, would you? There’s something I want you to have a look at.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember my Power Spot Detector, right? It detects places where Dynamaxing is possible... Basically when there’s a high concentration of Galar particles, the readings spike...[VAR 0114(000B)]
And that’s how I figured it out![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Power Spot Detector reacted when those two got close.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Could it be...?
So what does that mean?
Exactly![VAR 0114(000B)]
Basically...[VAR 0114(000B)]
follow the readings from the Power Spot Detector, and you might be able to find those sword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sordward and Shielbert might claim to be royalty, with their weird, fancy names. But it’s easier to just call them weirdos, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s get back on topic, though![VAR 0114(000B)]
I placed Power Spot Detectors all around Galar, and now it’s their time to shine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Power Spot Detectors—access![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, whoa! That’s a way bigger reaction than I would’ve thought! Looks like it’s coming from... Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You could always Dynamax Pokémon at the stadium, so that’s not exactly unusual. But these readings are way higher than normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
It can’t be Eternatus... You already caught it. Maybe it’s something related to those sword and shield weirdos?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You should go check it out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Since you’re our snazzy new Champion and all![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve set up your Town Map to show where the strong particle reactions are coming from, so have a look at it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll leave looking into Turffield to you. I’ll stay here and try to look into those rude weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m so glad to be working for Professor Sonia. To have a doctorate at such a young age... She’s really an amazing person.

Hm? You’re...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hello there, Champion! So, you came![VAR 0114(000E)]
What’s going on here?
It’s been a while
Hah! How carefree can you be? You’re the new Champion. You’re bigger than a Dynamax Pokémon right now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was actually in the middle of an exhibition match with Piers. Then this Dynamax Pokémon came charging in.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The audience and staff already took shelter.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Gyaaan!
I got everyone who was seated on the north side of the stadium evacuated! You must’ve heard, right? More Dynamax Pokémon are running amok![VAR 0114(0005)]
Much obliged, Hop! I’d expect nothing less from a Gym Challenger. I knew we could count on you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I lost in the Semifinals, though...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I chased those red and blue guys and saw them head into Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then I heard that uproar, and there was no way I could leave it alone. I had to help out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, er... Sorry! I actually lost sight of them in all the rush.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm. Those suspicious characters you saw are concerning...[VAR 0114(000E)]
But for now, I think we should get this Dynamax Pokémon to settle down first![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’d be glad for your help against such a tough- looking opponent, Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Of course!
Hold on a sec
All right. Then let’s head to the pitch.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll lend a hand, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t blame the Pokémon, of course, but I’m still just a bit miffed they upstaged me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You come too, bro of the old Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t know how much I can really help...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If I come along, I might just end up slowing the rest of you down...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t really know the guy, but I don’t think Leon’d be all lost about this. Though he does get actually lost a lot...[VAR 0114(0016)]
You comin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh... OK![VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers might look scary, but he’s great at looking after others. He’s a big brother, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, we should get going, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
OK! Preparation is as important as laying seeds for the next harvest.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you ready to battle the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Usin’ Pokémon to ruin this stage... The Trainers that did this ain’t gettin’ off easy if I find ’em.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wonder if there’s anything more I can do?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Mugyuuu.
Milo used a Revive!
Shaaanari.
Phew... Looks like things’ve finally calmed down a bit.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This Dynamax stuff... No matter how many times I see it, I still don’t like it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can see your dislike of Dynamaxing still hasn’t changed, Piers.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But there was definitely something off about that Dynamax transformation...[VAR 0114(000E)]
There wasn’t any Trainer anywhere! And the Pokémon seemed like it couldn’t even control the power itself...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Quite right... Normally, a Pokémon needs to respond to a Dynamax Band in order to Dynamax, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Seems there was some discord in the harmony between Trainer and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Did you feel anything unusual, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I did
I’m not sure
So you noticed something was off, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hmm, well, I suppose it is a bit early to start drawing any conclusions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no Trainer to be found. This really is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll make sure Turffield Gym takes good care of this Pokémon for the time being.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 24]
You lot really helped me out here. Thanks for that.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, and [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! If you should ever need my help, feel free to call me anytime.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right then. Follow me, little Tsareena.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Shaaanari.
Well, well, well! Looks like that Dynamax nonsense has calmed down.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well. The Champion, as expected.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Ah! It’s you two! I knew you’d be here! Give the [VAR ITEM2(0001)] back![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I never. It’s not like it’s something that belongs to you, either.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Even if it were yours, we wouldn’t give it back.[VAR 0114(0069)]
What’s with these two! Arrrghhh! Get over here so I can battle you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Who are these guys?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Spectators and staff should’ve been evacuated.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The normal rules simply just don’t apply to us![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes! That’s what it means to be celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
What?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Who is this ruffian to question us? You’re just someone with strange taste in hairstyles![VAR 0114(0068)]
His entire style is complete black and white nonsense. Isn’t it, Older Brother?[VAR 0114(0069)]
You think I’d put any faith in words from rude little punks like you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
But it seems our experiment was a success, Younger Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Quite, quite. Next time let us try to Dynamax an even stronger Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, yes! At last we shall reveal the true nature of Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0068)]
What was that about Zacian and Zamazenta?![VAR 0114(0005)]
You, despicable Champion! We’re going to keep letting Dynamax Pokémon run wild![VAR 0114(0069)]
If you want to stop us, do your best to chase after our splendid-looking bottoms![VAR 0114(0068)]
More like...celebrity bottoms![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
So you were the ones who caused all this? Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Calm down, Hop. You don’t gotta act so hard.[VAR 0114(0016)]
B-but they’re getting away![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, and they could be leadin’ us to a trap. It’s a bad idea to run in unprepared.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ughhh... Fine. You’re right. I get it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good. Let’s all calm down for a sec.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Thanks to them runnin’ their mouths, we know their goal is to force Pokémon to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And that they plan to continue doing it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I won’t allow it!
We have to stop them!
Yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is no time to be hung up on getting back the [VAR ITEM2(0001)]... [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Piers! We’ve got to stop those two![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’re those two makin’ Pokémon Dynamax without any Dynamax Bands?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Where would those red and blue buffoons have gone off to next? Let’s head out and look, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ah, there you are, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Things are a right proper mess![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just when I thought the Galar particle count around Turffield had calmed down...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I started getting huge Galar particle readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium![VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what exactly happened at Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Explain exactly what happened
Exaggerate what happened
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon went on a rampage?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon completely destroyed the stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait... Turffield Stadium is still there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh? Those sword and shield weirdos did it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm? Hop and...Piers?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Piers, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be back in Spikemuth?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m an ex-Gym Leader. I can be wherever I want. It’s not that weird![VAR 0114(0016)]
More importantly, you said there were Dynamax Pokémon at other stadiums?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. I’m getting the same readings in other towns as I was from Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m worried about Marnie![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, but Spikemuth Gym should be OK, right? I’m only seeing readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah... I see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If Pokémon are being forced to Dynamax and running wild, there’s no way I can simply sit by and watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s head to one of the stadiums!
I want to chase after those two weirdos!
Heh. That’s the spirit, Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even if we wanna go after them, we don’t know where they went...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Leave those sword and shield weirdos to me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I can poke around the net for sightings of them![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’ll leave the researchin’ to this, er... Sonia, was it? We should get to the other stadiums and help out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll catch up to you in a bit, so head out first. I’ll leave it up to you to decide which stadium we handle first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If someone’s in trouble, then I want to help! So, let’s get out there and do our best. All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos stick out like a sore thumb. It shouldn’t be too hard to find them. Time for a little searching on social media![VAR 0114(000B)]

We know the situation. Are the staff and spectators all right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. They took shelter just a short while ago...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know, the more I look at you three, the more I see how odd a little group you are.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Tch. Leave us alone.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We came here to help you out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m grateful for it. That Dynamax Pokémon’s power is so intense I’m sure it’d give me trouble.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d feel a lot more confident about it if you all joined the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s do it![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Because of everyone’s help, no one was hurt and we were able to turn the tide of the situation.[VAR 0114(000F)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... If you ever need my help, just let me know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose I’ll see you later, then? Thank you so much for your help, truly.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Mr. Kabu! I’m glad you remember me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I do! You two were red-hot, after all! I’ll never forget seeing you off after you’d completed your first leg of the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oi, can we save the nostalgia for later?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t think we really got the time for a friendly chin-wag.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right! Actually...the situation’s getting pretty bad over at the stadium.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Yeah. That’d be why we’re here.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, brilliant! The opponent’s a bit much to take on single-handedly, so I was wondering what to do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But with you all at my side, my confidence in this battle is burning brighter by the minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
Looks like we were able to extinguish things this time.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll let this Pokémon rest here at Motostoke Stadium until it gets its energy back.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], should you have need of my help, please do not hesitate to ask.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t worry—I know... You all have more work that needs to be done, yes?[VAR 0114(0010)]

What?! Sonia, you all right?![VAR 0114(0005)]
They keep rudely demanding I hand over Wishing Stars. I’m all right for now, but get over here quick, OK? These guys are right creepy![VAR 0114(000B)]

What’re those two doin’ goin’ after Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0016)]

Let’s hurry to the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]
He really doesn’t think anythin’ through... Sure does make him seem a proper fool. Nah, guess the word would be “reckless.”[VAR 0114(0016)]

You noncelebrities are not suited to having such valuable things. Hand them over to us.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wishing Stars and being a celebrity have nothing to do with each other![VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t know how you knew about this, but there’s no way we’re giving them to you![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! You could never understand how important these Wishing Stars are. You have no need for them![VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness. Whatever should we do, Younger Brother?[VAR 0114(0068)]
It would certainly seem we have been inconvenienced, Older Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah!
Sonia and the professor are the ones who’ve been inconvenienced here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Forcing Pokémon to Dynamax against their will... You’ve gone way out of bounds here![VAR 0114(0005)]
And I haven’t forgot about getting back the [VAR ITEM2(0001)], either![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, well, well! I certainly thought the Champion would come, but I didn’t think a loser would follow.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Must I have you once again taste the flavor of a humiliating defeat?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Rrrghhh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let these goons put you down![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0016)]
You lost a battle, but don’t lose that rockin’ spirit![VAR 0114(0016)]
R-right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Steady on
We’ll fight them together
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Thanks, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
First thing’s first! Let’s get these weirdos out of here![VAR 0114(0005)]
W— W-w-w... W-w-w...WEIRDOS?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oh, how they wound me, Older Brother! To be called so terrible a thing as “weirdos” by these ruffians![VAR 0114(0069)]
Indeed! To address royals such as ourselves in such a manner cannot—will not—be forgiven![VAR 0114(0068)]
This time I’ve brought much stronger Pokémon to thoroughly trounce you with![VAR 0114(0069)]
I did it... We won! We really won![VAR 0114(0005)]
The exquisite Pokémon we trained actually lost?![VAR 0114(0068)]
Harumph! You only won because you two teamed up. Still, we offer you ruffians our praise.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oi. The two of you teamed up, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Give back the [VAR ITEM2(0001)], and stop forcing Pokémon to go all crazy![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, sorry... Is this a bad time?
My apologies for the intrusion.
Those men are dangerous! Be careful![VAR 0114(000B)]
... ... ...
Well done. Your infiltration mission was a resounding success, it seems.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Have you gathered the Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, thanks to Masters Sordward and Shielbert buying me so much time.
The assistant handed the Wishing Stars over to Sordward and Shielbert!
What? Stop! Give back those Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh dear... It would seem we’ve been completely had.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Fwaheeheehoho! Why, this moment is so sweet, I don’t think I’ll need any sugar in my tea later![VAR 0114(0068)]
Our battle with you was just a little trick! We’d won before you’d grabbed a single Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell!
Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Professor Sonia...I’m sorry.
Was everything... Was it all a lie, right from the start?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There was no helping it. It was necessary for the plan.
Our plan to put Galar under the control of the royal lineage once again...
... ... ...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I think she’s gonna need some cheerin’ from her real friends.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So those two weren’t working alone? One of their followers even betrayed Sonia... That’s real rough...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems that lot did have something to back up all their big talk...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Wait! Don’t just leave without saying anything![VAR 0114(000B)]
But...you were upset. We didn’t want to say anything to make it worse.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We were tryin’ to be considerate, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Of course I’d be down on myself! It was my fault I got tricked by a Nickit in Wooloo’s clothing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that’s it! No more feeling sorry for myself![VAR 0114(000B)]
That lot made off like bandits with all the Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’d be awful if they were used for some evil purpose, so there’s no time to be feeling down![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh. Hehehe... You’ve got some guts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’ve certainly grown strong in the face of adversity, dearie.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gran...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Dynamaxing draws out the true strength from the trust between a Pokémon and their Trainer.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But that group is likely pouring the Galar particles emitted by the Wishing Stars into Pokémon, forcing them to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s awful!
That would explain the theft...
Indeed. What an awful thing to do to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As expected of the Champion. Your intuition is quite sharp, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
The theft of the Wishing Stars was just the start. Things could get a lot worse from here on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But why? What reason could they have for forcing Pokémon to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those weirdos said that they wanted to reveal the true natures of Zacian and Zamazenta.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m curious about what my former assistant said about a royal lineage. Did she mean it literally?[VAR 0114(000B)]
...Ah! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Look at your Town Map![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m detecting huge reactions at four stadiums now![VAR 0114(000B)]
They certainly get around, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If there’s trouble at the stadiums, then Marnie could be in a real bad way![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, Spikemuth seems to be OK. There’s no Power Spot stadium there...[VAR 0114(000B)]
*ahem* Righto...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! This is no time to be lying about![VAR 0114(0005)]
If Pokémon are in trouble, why’re we still here?! Let’s get right out there to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sorry to leave it all to you, but you’ll have to take care of the Dynamax Pokémon. I’ll search for those sword and shield weirdos in the meantime![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wishing Stars were one component of the Darkest Day... If they have that many, they could cause Pokémon to Dynamax like Eternatus did.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Nice timing, you lot![VAR 0114(0017)]
The stadium’s just about reached its limit! There’re simply too many Dynamax Pokémon running wild in there![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seems Wishing Star power is bein’ used for some evil purpose.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So that’s what’s caused all this? That’s a problem, all right... But before we get that sorted, we’ve got to do something about these Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
Glad we’ve got you all here now. Though we’ve already done the bulk of the work![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re here to help, too! Right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Leave it to us!
We’ll take care of this!
Especially you, Piers! The way you battled me in the Champion Cup... You really had my Dynamax Pokémon up against the wall![VAR 0114(0017)]
Things might actually go better this time if we split up our little band.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Fantastic! Looks like we’ve got ourselves together an unbeatable team![VAR 0114(0017)]
Right! Everyone, split up so we can each take down one of the Dynamax Pokémon! Let’s do it![VAR 0114(0017)]

You guys are the greatest! You really got me out of a tough spot here! I think I’d better snap a quick one to remember this victory by.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon that went wild. No need for you all to worry about that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Give me a ring if things should go to pot again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m always happy to lend a hand if I can. The great Raihan is here for you anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Piers! You and I have got to battle again. This time, no Dynamaxing for either of us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wishing Stars being used for evil... I assume you all are already looking into who’s behind it, right? Carry on, then. I’ll take care of things here at Hammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0017)]

...Oh. You. You came to help me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eh, somethin’ like that. How’re things lookin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We just finished getting everyone to safety, so I was about to challenge the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The people all got out... But I’m the Gym Leader... I’ll...battle the Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 5]

Nice one! Then let’s all work together![VAR 0114(0005)]
I give you my most heartfelt thanks![VAR 0114(0011)]
That’d... That’d be brilliant, thanks![VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ve got several opponents, so we may as well take one each. I’ll be counting on you all![VAR 0114(0011)]
There are loads of ’em... I hope everyone...can take one each. Please![VAR 0114(0012)]
Here we go![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Let’s go![VAR 0114(0012)]

I can’t thank you all enough. With your help, the Dynamax Pokémon have all been returned to normal.[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Th-thanks. A lot. The Pokémon have all calmed down...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll keep them safe here in the stadium, so no need to worry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They can rest here... They...should be fine in time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Next time I’ll be the one who saves you in your hour of need. Give me a call if you’re ever in a rough spot.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Here... My League Card.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If there are other places that need a Champion’s help, please go look after them![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Y-you can leave things here to me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll protect the peace of Stow-on-Side Stadium with all my might![VAR 0114(0011)]
...I-I’d rather you go help those who need you![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hmph. You lot.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede?! What about the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You think I, the elite Fairy-type Gym Leader, would have any kind of trouble?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right—you’re a Gym Leader now! Though I don’t know about “elite” or whatever.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Please...please don’t tell me you came here to help? First of all, you’re a bit late to be of any use, and second, I didn’t need any help.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why’d I know you’d say something like that...? We came all the way out here just to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
What an obnoxious Gym Leader. The next Gym Challenge is shapin’ up to really be somethin’.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oleana tricked and used me... From now on, only I decide how I live![VAR 0114(000C)]
And I think what I should do now is have a battle with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m sorry, mate, but... this is hardly the time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t always be in such a hurry, boy. You aced my quiz, so show a little composure.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede has already quieted three Dynamax Pokémon. He’s given you the luxury of some extra time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede’s life won’t be bound by what other people say any longer. Although I certainly influenced a few of his decisions not too long ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that you mention it...I suppose you did.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, yeah. As expected of a wise 88-year-old granny, I guess.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But this has nothing to do with Ms. Opal. This battle’s for me! Now, don’t dillydally! Your only option is to accept![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll battle you
I understand!
My Pokémon and I have risen from the ashes... I’ll grant you a brief glimpse at how amazing we’ve become.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you for the battle. I can now accept you as the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s painful to admit, but I’ve come to realize a few of my weaknesses.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I’ll keep getting stronger. I’ll reach the pinnacle of what Fairy types can do.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now then, as the Gym Leader, I will do my duty and clean the stadium.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, that’s what I would call a perfectly pink Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
Even after losing his right to participate in the Gym Challenge, Bede still found his own way to crash the Champion Cup... Yeah, I’d say he’s a force to be reckoned with.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I get why he was chosen to be the next Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He might be unbearable at times—or really, most all the time—but he’s a fierce Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He takes things seriously
He’s really strong
Yeah. Watching him battle you, it was plain to see how much work he puts into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s strong enough that even a Champion like you recognizes it, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you both are gonna keep talkin’, how ’bout I fetch you a nice cuppa?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right, right, I hear you! And I won’t be outdone by that Bede or anyone! On to the next one![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s here, so everyone can relax![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was just thinking over how to handle all the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
There appear to be no less than four Dynamax Pokémon. I was just going over a plan on how to handle things.[VAR 0114(0015)]
With all of you here, we can each take one of them on![VAR 0114(0014)]
With all these strong Trainers together, I’m sure we can work something out here![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let’s hurry to the pitch.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Are you all ready, then? Let’s head to the pitch![VAR 0114(0015)]

Nice work, everyone. No one’s hurt, are they?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Phew! Is everyone feeling all right?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hah...hah... Just barely![VAR 0114(0005)]
Battling a Dynamax Pokémon all on your own is pretty hard work![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hehe. I expected nothing less from you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You seem like quite the reliable Trainer, too, Hop.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ohoho! Of course you had no problem, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You really seem like a reliable Trainer, too, Hop![VAR 0114(0015)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like he ain’t used to compliments. Look, he’s got a grin wider than a Meowth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I do not! Shut your gob, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled, so there’s no need for any of you to worry, all right?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled. No need for anyone to worry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]. It’s hardly a reward for what you’ve done for me, but please take a copy of my League Card.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]. It’s not much of a reward, but have a copy of my League Card.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If anything comes up, please contact me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Give me a call if anything happens![VAR 0114(0015)]
All right then. I wish you all the best of luck for the future![VAR 0114(0014)]
Don’t overdo it out there![VAR 0114(0015)]

So the reason those red and blue buffoons could make so many Pokémon Dynamax was because they hoarded up so many Wishing Stars...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! We’ve got to go help all the other places where these Dynamax Pokémon are running wild![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like most of the stadiums have got this Dynamax problem sorted now. Let’s keep up the pace, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right! I think that’s all the stadiums sorted now! We didn’t miss any, did we, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
Things’ll probably get even tougher from here. We still got three more stadiums where there’s some Dynamax Pokémon runnin’ wild. Let’s up the tempo.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like there’s two Pokémon Stadiums left to check.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There’s only one Pokémon Stadium with Dynamax trouble left. Let’s finish this already.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All that’s left is to catch those sword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If we don’t find them quick, they could just start all this up again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wasn’t Professor Sonia s’pposed to be lookin’ into where those two might be?[VAR 0114(0016)]
And once we find them again, I’m going to take them right down![VAR 0114(0005)]
*beep beep beep*
That’s your Rotom Phone, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! It’s got to be Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]? It’s me! Sonia![VAR 0114(000B)]
Heh! Called it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos got into Hammerlocke Stadium and are headed for the Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The door to the plant’s locked, but I think I can get it open. Give me a bit, and you’ll be able to get in there![VAR 0114(000B)]
You hear that? Hammerlocke Stadium. Get over there as soon as you can![VAR 0114(000B)]
Even over the phone, Sonia sure sounds lively...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We should hurry to Hammerlocke Stadium.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I’ll work on getting the door to the roof open. Can you take care of what’s going on in the stadiums, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]

It’s trying to suppress and calm itself, but it can’t control all the power![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I was hopin’ we could just calm it down like we did with the others. But our opponent is a Legendary Pokémon. If you’re thinkin’ about catchin’ it, think again.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 27]
I hate to admit it, but if anyone can stop it, it’s got to be you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll keep everyone else safe down here! So you don’t have to worry about a thing! You just focus on calming down [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s coming, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
Gugyaaagogugu!
Gugyaaagogugu!
Fhuuu! Fhuuu...
Fhuuu! Fhuuu...
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]... Are you...all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop! Watch out![VAR 0114(000B)]
Arooo!
Arooo!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]?![VAR 0114(0005)]

Bowoof!
Bowoof!
Thanks for saving me, [VAR PKNAME(0001)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like it still can’t control all that power...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t like this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... Not one bit. I’m going to go after [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
And this belongs to [VAR PKNAME(0001)]—not you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah...[VAR 0114(0069)]
Ah...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Hop took back the [VAR ITEM2(0001)]!
Guaou!
Guaou!
Gyaaah![VAR 0114(0069)]
Gyaaah![VAR 0114(0068)]
P-please! Don’t hurt my younger brother![VAR 0114(0068)]
P-please! Don’t hurt my older brother![VAR 0114(0069)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Wait!
... ... ...
... ... ...
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] stares into your eyes.
As expected of the Champion... You took complete control of the situation. Plus it looks like that Pokémon is waitin’ for you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Amazing... Absolutely incredible, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... I wonder if [VAR PKNAME(0001)] is thanking you, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
S-such a fearsome creature... And we thought we could control it as we pleased? Truly, we have been foolish fools![VAR 0114(0069)]
S-such a fearsome creature... And we thought we could control it as we pleased? Truly, we have been foolish fools![VAR 0114(0068)]
My younger brother is unharmed. For that, you have my gratitude...[VAR 0114(0068)]
My older brother is unharmed. For that, you have my gratitude...[VAR 0114(0069)]
It seems we have lost. We apologize for any trouble we’ve caused...

[VAR PKNAME(0001)] gives you a calm look.
Ready the [VAR ITEM2(0002)] to catch [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Grrrrrriiieeeld!!!
Lrrroooaaarrrd!!!
It seems like [VAR PKNAME(0001)] is testing you.
Wow, brilliant![VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems like you’ve been recognized by real royalty![VAR 0114(000B)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0069)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Ah.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What a sublime battle.[VAR 0114(0069)]
What a sublime battle.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We were so preoccupied with fussing over who the new king was... How terribly uncouth-like.[VAR 0114(0069)]
We were so preoccupied with fussing over who the new king was... How terribly uncouth-like.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Hey, you. Spiky head.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey, you. Spiky head.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Ugh... Why should I go expectin’ those two to start learnin’ some manners now?[VAR 0114(0016)]
My older brother and I will atone for our crimes. Please escort us to the appropriate place.[VAR 0114(0069)]
My younger brother and I will atone for our crimes. Please escort us to the appropriate place.[VAR 0114(0068)]
If you really wanna atone, what’s with that posh, superior attitude?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, whatever...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], I think I understand why you became the Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But...please don’t go callin’ me anymore. Seems like I’m only gettin’ called out when you’re in some sticky situation.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Professor Sonia...
I can’t ask you to forgive me. But I am truly sorry for deceiving you.
I was really hurt at first, but I’ve rallied. Thanks to you, I ended up learning quite a bit... Ah, that came off a bit more sarcastic than I thought it would![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hehe... Well, please continue to do your best as a professor.
Righto! We’ve stopped them from causing any harm! Still, I hope [VAR PKNAME(0001)] is OK...[VAR 0114(000B)]
*beep beep beep*
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], your Rotom Phone! Probably Hop, I reckon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hello? [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]?! I was just— Whoa! Hey, calm down![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyaaaun!
Kyaaaun!
Heh! I suppose you heard that? Yeah, I’ve got [VAR PKNAME(0001)] here with me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Are you OK?
Where are you?
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] started going crazy, so things have been better! But I’m hanging in there...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] was going wild in the Slumbering Weald, but I’m doing my best to keep it in check![VAR 0114(0005)]
I could sure use your help, though! Get over here quick as you can, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be waiting for you in the heart of the Slumbering Weald![VAR 0114(0005)]
He sure sounds like he’s got his hands full. Guess some things never change![VAR 0114(000B)]
Grrrrrriiieeeld!!!
Lrrroooaaarrrd!!!
Even in its Poké Ball, [VAR PKNAME(0002)] seems worried about its partner.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We should go to the Slumbering Weald and see how Hop and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing.[VAR 0114(000B)]

There, there... Everything’s all right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Grrr...
Grrr...
You don’t have to lose control. You can manage this. I know you can! You’re the true hero who protected the Galar region, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Rrr...
Rrr...
...Bark!
...Bark!
Oh? Got everything under control? See! I knew you could do it, champ![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop! You look a fright![VAR 0114(000B)]
You two made it! And yeah, well, I was just focused on trying to calm down [VAR PKNAME(0001)], so...[VAR 0114(0005)]
*sigh* Rushing in and trying to calm a legendary hero head on was awful reckless...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Bark!
Bark!
It looks happy now
Hop, you’re amazing
Yeah... It does, doesn’t it? Though I can tell you, things were looking pretty dire here at first![VAR 0114(0005)]
Y-you think? I’m pretty chuffed to hear that from you of all people, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kuuun.
Kuuun.
What? Wait, really?! Y-you sure about this?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What did [VAR PKNAME(0001)] say?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That it thinks I’m worthy of it... That it’ll become my Pokémon... I’m pretty sure that was it, anyway![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, seriously?! That’s totally crazy![VAR 0114(000B)]
Is it...is it really OK?[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, here I go, then...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hyah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop caught [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
You two really are something![VAR 0114(000B)]
I still don’t quite see anything like that in myself yet...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But thanks to your help, I’m starting to![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ve got a favor to ask![VAR 0114(0005)]
Though I hate to look like I’m copying that posh jerk, Bede... Still! I want another battle against you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everything started right here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
in the Slumbering Weald![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop sure must be tough if he’s been accepted by [VAR PKNAME(0001)]. Make sure you’re in top form before challenging him.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you need some time to prepare, I can take you back to the entrance of the woods.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Want me to show you to the center of the woods, where Hop is waiting?[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right! Let’s get a move on.[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Take all the time you need to prepare.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Good! I wouldn’t want you to be at anything less than your best for a serious match like this![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right! Let’s go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

That’s our greatest Champion for you... You really are strong, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
But getting beat this time felt a bit different. I may’ve lost, but I feel great![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know what, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I think I’ve found a dream of my own![VAR 0114(0005)]
I want to be someone who can help out Pokémon that’re in trouble, wherever they are... I think I want to become a Pokémon Professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
I started thinking I might when we were going around to all the stadiums to help the Pokémon that were running out of control.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know I don’t know enough about Pokémon yet, and I’ve got no experience for this sort of thing, but I’m gonna study and learn a whole lot![VAR 0114(0005)]
And someday I’ll become the sort of professor that you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], and you, Sonia... well, the sort you would be proud to know![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna take a different path than you and Lee are taking, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...but... I’ll still always think of you as my true rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s nothing I’d like better!
I still don’t plan on losing to you!
Same here. We’ll always be rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not like I plan on losing to you, either! Even if our goals are different now... we’ll always be proper rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ahhh! No fair. You two are so young and cute.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m tearing up.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia! Getting a bit weepy in your old age, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! I’m still young and super energetic![VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, Hop. Fancy becoming my assistant at the lab?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got all the books and data on Pokémon you could ever want![VAR 0114(000B)]
Since you want to be a professor someday, I’ll oversee your studies![VAR 0114(000B)]
Then I definitely want to! Only...you sure I can really be any help to you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course! Mind you, it’ll be a lot of work. Work’s really been piling up since I lost my first assistant![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! So what you really mean is you’re offering me the position to help yourself out? Ah, fine! I’ll still do a bang-up job![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll have my back, too—right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and...here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You should take this![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] and I, well... We’re gonna do our best together to work toward achieving that dream. So until we do...you keep it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
*clap clap clap*
Well, well, well now! That certainly was a splendid battle and a refreshing back and forth, eh wot?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well now... That really touched my heart![VAR 0114(0069)]
Huh?! Sordward and Shielbert...with Piers? And even Lee?![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you lot doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
No need for the noisemakery, young lady.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We have come to meet with the young M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0069)]
They didn’t get the chance to properly apologize yet.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And I’m here to keep an eye on them. They did technically descend from the original kings of Galar, after all.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Seems you lot have been up to all sorts of things while I was stuck in Rose Tower trying to take care of the mess the chairman left behind.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve no idea! Those two were forcing Pokémon to Dynamax all over the place![VAR 0114(0005)]
And for that, we are really, truly sorry. Look at our sorriness.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We thought only of ourselves and brought harm to innocent Pokémon. We have truly caused a large amount of trouble.[VAR 0114(0069)]
M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you helped us even though we did those awful things...[VAR 0114(0068)]
You are so worthy of the throne, you could say it’s a Dynamax-sized amount of worthiness![VAR 0114(0069)]
I already told you two... Zacian and Zamazenta are the real royalty.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Incorrect! We have abdicated the title to h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer. There are no other rulers but [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0068)]
Hmm. Now that I look closely, you absolutely do have the air of a celebrity![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, fancy that... I think you’ve grown on them, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh dear... Reluctantly, I’m afraid we two must away.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Our tour to apologize to those we’ve troubled awaits![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well then... Good-bye! Wahahahah!![VAR 0114(006A)]
Oi! Don’t go runnin’ off on your own.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
Er, what?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Just so you know, I saw your Pokémon battle against Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
You sure have gotten strong! You were so good, I nearly sent out my Charizard without thinking, wanting to join in on the fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
It seems like you’ve found your own path to walk in life, Hop.[VAR 0114(0004)]
As your older brother... No, as your rival, you have my full support![VAR 0114(0004)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh? Leon gave you some pretty high praise. You look like the Meowth’s got your tongue, Hop.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Awww, zip it, Sonia! I do not! Hehehe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I guess we should get going, too...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right! Then it’s a race to see who gets back home first![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know you haven’t reached your full potential yet, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Train and prepare as much as you like. I’ll be waiting here whenever you’re ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
Adventure across the Galar region to find many more Pokémon to battle and catch! The Battle Tower in Wyndon has opened, too! It’s filled with Trainers stronger than those you’ve faced up until now. Challenge them if you dare!
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’m giving it my best with my studies! It’s not easy, but it’s still great fun![VAR 0114(0005)]
If it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Hop’s been studying pretty hard, surprisingly. I’m sure he’d be glad to know you dropped by for a visit.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still hard at work today, are you? Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Morning, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still hard at work today, huh, Champ? Would you like to rest your Pokémon?

We hope to see you again!
Happy birthday! I hope you’ll keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come! Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches itself to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Happy birthday, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you. Each and every day!
Oh, today is a special day! I know it’s a day early, but happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your Pokémon’s HP is getting low. And if you’re planning to go far off the beaten path, you should probably remember to stock up on Potions from the Poké Mart, too. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
Oh, you’re back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Looks like you and your team are tuckered out. You should have a nice rest while you’re home. ... ... ... ... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now, that’s more like it! You and your Pokémon should be all rested and ready for anything! Be sure to take care of your Pokémon when their HP gets low and they’re too tired to battle.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon!

Uh... Now who was I again? ... ... ... ... ... ... Oh yes! I’m the Move Deleter! I can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You’re here so I can make your Pokémon forget a move, um-hmm?
Which Pokémon would that be?
Just remember me when there’s something you want to forget!
What’s that, friend? That Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What’s this, friend? Eggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm... And which move should it forget?
It was a great success! Your Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even knew [VAR MOVE(0000)]!
Everyone calls me Madam Memorial. I know every move that a Pokémon learns as it grows, you see. I can also help your Pokémon remember any of those moves that it has let go in the past. I’ll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves in exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a long-forgotten move?
If there’s a move you want one of your Pokémon to recall, bring me a [VAR ITEM2(0000)]!
Which Pokémon is it?
That is an Egg.
This Pokémon doesn’t yet have any moves to be recovered.
Which move would you like it to remember?
You gave a [VAR ITEM2(0000)] in thanks.
Now it has remembered that move! Come again if you need anything else!
Would you like me to teach Volt Tackle to your Pikachu?
If you come to me with Pikachu, I’d be happy to teach it Volt Tackle.
Pikanium Z will turn Pikachu’s Volt Tackle into its Z-Move!
Which Pikachu would you like me to teach the move to?

Moves that only select Pokémon can learn... They are called battle-combo moves. Do you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon to learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you’re with right now can learn my move. That’s too bad!

[VAR PKNICK(0001)] can’t learn my move.

Battle-combo moves... How you combine them with each other is the key to using them well!
Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna or professor, maybe? It doesn’t matter if it’s evolved into something else since then. As long as it’s a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type Pokémon that new Trainers are given around here, and it’s really friendly toward you, I’ll teach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
A special move... Shall I teach your Pokémon a battle-combo move?
There is no move that I can teach to any of the Pokémon you are with...
I see... Well, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be, then?
That Pokémon can’t learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?! You are being unreasonable.
This Pokémon... It doesn’t look like it’s too comfortable with you yet.
That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
Do you want me to teach [VAR PKNAME(0000)] [VAR MOVE(0001)]?
My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you get from people like professors or kahunas. I teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to those Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve from them. That’s what I do!

The strongest Dragon-type move is called Draco Meteor. Do you want me to teach the move to your Pokémon?
I understand... Moves that are too strong can be difficult to use.
It looks like your Pokémon can learn my move, but there’s one condition that needs to be met. That is...the Pokémon has to be completely friendly toward you. I can teach the move only after the Pokémon becomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can learn this move... Come back when you obtain a Pokémon that can learn this move!
Then please select the Pokémon that will learn this move.
Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg. It can’t learn this move or any move.
Oh, this Pokémon already knows Draco Meteor.
Draco Meteor is indeed the strongest Dragon-type move. However, using it harshly lowers the user’s Sp. Atk stat.

Let me guess! You want me to teach Dragon Ascent to your Pokémon. Am I correct?
You don’t seem to have Rayquaza—the only Pokémon that can learn Dragon Ascent.
Come back any time you need my help.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach the move to?
That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent. Only Rayquaza can learn the move.
I’ve never heard of an Egg that can use Dragon Ascent!
That Rayquaza has already learned Dragon Ascent.
Do you want me to teach Dragon Ascent to that [VAR PKNAME(0000)] of yours?
Dragon Ascent is a powerful move that only Rayquaza can use. They say its power is so strong that even a huge meteoroid can be broken into pieces with one attack.

Do you have Pokémon you’d like to enter in a Ranked Battle?

Which Pokémon would you like to enter in a Ranked Battle?

So, we’ll be having [VAR PKNAME(0000)] forget the moves that it knew before in order to learn the moves for this Ranked Battle. That fine by you?
It might forget some really rare moves that’ll be impossible for it to relearn. That’s all right, too?
Then let’s get [VAR PKNAME(0000)] all sorted! It’ll be entered into the Ranked Battle at once!

Welcome to the Nursery. How may I help you?
Nice to see a new face around here. This is a Pokémon Nursery. We take care of people’s Pokémon here. When people leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Eggs. If you’re interested in that sort of thing, ask the old lady inside to tell you more. Do you want to leave any Pokémon with me?
Do come back soon.
We found your Pokémon holding an Egg. Would you like to take it?
Is that so? In that case, we’ll keep it ourselves.
You received an Egg from the Nursery worker!
Take good care of it, and raise it well.
It looks like your Boxes are all full. Have a look at them and come again, won’t you?
[VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine.
Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. They really seem to enjoy each other’s company.
Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. They seem to get along all right.
Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Though... They don’t seem very fond of one another.
Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Though... They don’t seem to like playing together at all...
I’m afraid you’d be left with too few Pokémon if I took any from you now.
You can leave up to two Pokémon with us. Which Pokémon should we look after?
We’re looking after [VAR PKNICK(0000)] now. Which other Pokémon would you like us to take?
It will cost 1,000 to leave two Pokémon. Would you like to leave them both?
It will cost 500 to leave one Pokémon. Would you like to leave your Pokémon with me?
That will be an additional 500, please.
Then you can trust us with both [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)]! I’ll take fine care of them.
Then leave [VAR PKNICK(0000)] with me.
Whenever you want to collect your Pokémon, do let me know.
You don’t seem to have enough money...
Things are going just fine. Would you like to take your Pokémon back anyway?
Just a moment, then. I’ll go get your [VAR PKNICK(0000)].
[~ 25]
Would you care to take [VAR PKNICK(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party, so I can only take one from you just now.
Welcome to the Nursery! How can I help you?
Hello! This here is the Wild Area branch of the Pokémon Nursery! We’re just as capable as the Nursery on Route 5. Don’t you worry about a thing! Will you be leaving any Pokémon with us today?
Come again!
Your Pokémon was found holding an Egg! Would you like to take it with you?
If you’re sure, then I’ll keep it myself!
[~ 33]
Take good care of it, and raise it well!

Would you care to take [VAR PKNICK(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party, so we’ll take just one for now, all right?
I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. I help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers like you. Lately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon holding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it? If you want us to take care of your Pokémon, please speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola, Champion! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing just fine! They really seem to like hanging out!
Alola! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing just fine! They seem to get along all right.
Alola! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing just fine! They don’t seem to like each other very much, though.
Alola! [VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing just fine! They don’t seem to like playing together, though.
Oh hey! I have surprising news for you! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! It’s like a total mystery where it came from, but you want the Egg your Pokémon was holding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh, your party is full... Please come back again after making space for the Egg.
I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it, don’t you?
Then I’ll take it. Thank you.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. We can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. What would you like to do?
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady. Champion, what would you like to do?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be able to battle. Please come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly. That’s an Egg!
All right. I’ll take care of your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] for a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don’t you? Do you want to take one back?
[~ 81]
If you want your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back now, it will cost you [VAR NUM5(0001,002C)].
You don’t seem to have enough money...
You took back your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you’ll be left with only the one. Catch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full! Make room, and then come see me again.
I’d like to leave Pokémon
I’d like to take my Pokémon back
Never mind
Is everything OK?

Stopper message (TBD)
At last, the Gym Challenge’s opening ceremony! My heart is pounding with all the excitement!
Corrr!
Motostoke is something else! What other city has a lift to take you between the upper and the lower districts?
The eight Gym Leaders that challengers have to face... They’re all frightfully strong. I wonder if any of the Gym Challengers stand a chance.
[~ 5]
No wandering into that tall grass for you if you’ve got no Pokémon of your own, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
You can’t go any farther in with that Wooloo standing in the way!
And where do you think you’re off to, then? We’re having a battle—you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Be serious, would you? We’ve got to go look for that Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Sorry, but Team Yell caused quite the kerfuffle, and now the bridge is in a bit of a state... We’ll have things cleaned quick as can be done, but could you give us some time?
If you’re looking for your Bag, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], didn’t you leave it in your room? And grab yourself a hat for the weather, as well![VAR 0114(0008)]
Heya, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hop was looking for you, you know. But no need to go to the next town to find him when he lives right next door, right?
[~ 15]
You did tell your mum that we’re heading to Wedgehurst, right? She’ll go spare if you disappear without a word.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mzzz... Mzzz...
You wouldn’t want to wake up the sweet sleeping Wooloo, right? Better to take the long way round.
Let’s go and meet Lee at the station! It’s dead ahead from here![VAR 0114(0005)]
My Wooloo simply loves the Pokémon Center. Come along, Wooloo! You’re perfectly healed! Time we go back home!
Meeeeeeh...
I lost to the Trainers out training their teams on Route 2... I just can’t believe it... Give me a moment to process, would you? I’m in shock here.
The Slumbering Weald is over this way! Let’s go find that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe the chairman was quite clear. Get your Water Badge at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You must be a Gym Challenger, right? If you’re looking for the Gym Leader, Nessa, she’s off at the lighthouse. The lighthouse is, well... If you head toward the sea from here, you shouldn’t be able to miss it.
We’re blockin’ off this route to get in the way of Gym Challengers—you got that? “Our Marnie’s all done with Hulbury! Our Marnie’s all done with the sea! Our Marnie defeats every leader, and she’ll bring us all sweet victory!”
Team Yell’s hard at work trainin’ up our Pokémon t’be extra hard here in Galar Mine No. 2!
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our chants here?! “You’re not passin’! You’re not passin’! You’re not passin’, not through here! You’ll not get through till we’re all done here!”
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our cheers here?! “M-A-R-N-I-and-E! That’s how we spell victory!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell! “She’s cute! She’s tough! She won’t take no one’s guff! Ooour Marnie! She’s our Marnie!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell! “Glory, glory, to our Marnie! Glory, glory, to our Marnie! Glory, glory, to our Marnie! As our girl goes marchin’ on!”
Excuse me! You need permission to enter the vault here in Hammerlocke!
You can’t drown us out, mate! We’ll just turn the volume up! “M-A-R N-I-E! That spells victory to me! With the knick-knack paddywhack, give Growlithe a bone... Marnie’s gonna send you home!”
[~ 34]
Corviknight is a Pokémon that flies all about carrying people where they want to go. But even they get tuckered out...
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet. You can’t enter without the Fire Badge. Would you like me to take you back to the bridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Got it! Then come with me!
Got it! Well, don’t push yourself too hard. Set up camp or something when you need a rest!
My Corviknight got all rested up, so it’s already headed off on its next Poké Job!

Fugaaa! Fugagaga! I’m a Pokémon! Have a battle with me!
Listen for a second. Scorbunny and Sizzlipede are different species, but they’re still both Pokémon. Scorbunny and I are different species, just like Sizzlipede and I are different, too. If you think about it that way, there’s no problem with calling me a Pokémon. I don’t mind.
What? You don’t have to worry about me. Even I know it’s pretty lofty logic. I...I wanted to become a Pokémon once.
You can be one
Well...good luck with that
Hey, I’ve got it! A change of fashion style could change the way I feel, too! Basically, if I can make myself feel the way a Pokémon does, it’d be like I became a Pokémon, don’t you think?
You! Would you please put on some clothes with a fiery spirit that embodies my burning feelings?
I appreciate you encouraging me, but I can’t feel like a Pokémon that way. Please! Show me some clothes with a Fire-type design!
What’s this? Is that...? I feel like I’ve completely become a Pokémon. Wearing a hot, fire-styled outfit can make you feel different. I feel like I’ve become a Fire-type Pokémon!
Thanks for cheering me up! It’s hardly a proper reward, but I hope you like it anyway. Acrobatics is a move that does more damage if the user isn’t holding an item!
I’ve been thinking... If a Cramorant swallowed me, and then someone else caught it... Would I be able to go inside the Poké Ball, too? If I did, I’d be the first person in humanity’s history to be caught by a Poké Ball. “Gotcha! A man was caught!” They’d have to say something like that, right? Basically that means I’d equal a Pokémon, no? Yeah. Yeah, definitely “no.”

[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)], you look a little more Champion-like, huh? Only a little, though.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What’re you gawkin’ at? It’s exactly what you think. I look wicked as a Gym Leader, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I wanna show everyone that even if you can’t Dynamax, you can still use other tactics and have a lot of fun![VAR 0114(000D)]
C’mon, Champ! How ’bout an exhibition match?[VAR 0114(000D)]

OK! I’m gonna give you somethin’ important. So keep it safe or I’ll get mad, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come back any time you’re free. I don’t mind trainin’ against you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just couldn’t stay away, eh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Guess it can’t be helped. Shall I beat you hollow?[VAR 0114(000D)]
If I’m not good enough to beat you yet, that means I definitely can’t go sayin’ I’ve surpassed my bro![VAR 0114(000D)]
Battling the Champion sure is excitin’! Be sure to come back again, OK? Morpeko and I will be waitin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

A treasure lies buried somewhere in Turffield...
According to this treasure map, the trick to finding the treasure lies in the standing stones. “Seek yourself three standing stones, with Grass before the other ones. Use well that strength, and find then the strength of its strength in the end. Dally not, if you’ve a mind To find what time has left behind.” ...That’s what it says, but I can’t make heads or tails of it!
What?! You actually managed to find treasure?! That’s amazing! I was completely stuck!
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Grass.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Water.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Fire.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Flying.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Poison.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone. It says: “Dark.”
There’s something buried in the ground!

You’ll run into stronger wild Pokémon the farther you go into the Wild Area. If you feel like you’re in a pinch during a battle, just use a Poké Doll!
No matter how strong a Pokémon is, you’ll be able to catch it eventually, so long as you join in the Gym Challenge and gather the Gym Badges!

It’s a Toxel! A real Toxel! I found an Egg, and carried it around with me— and it hatched into a Toxel! Why don’t you raise it? It’s a real shocking Pokémon!
Tox tox!
And take these, too! They’ll help your Pokémon grow if you use them!
Eggs are found at Pokémon Nurseries! Exp. Candies are found from Max Raid Battles! And you’ve found yourself a real nice friend today, wouldn’t you say?

Would you like to test your knowledge about type matchups?
OK. So here’s the first question!
[VAR TYPE(0001)]-type moves are super effective against which type of Pokémon?
[VAR TYPE(0002)]
Ding ding ding! Right answer!
Bzzzzzz! That’s incorrect!
The next question!
Please try again.
You got [VAR NUM1(0004)] out of [VAR NUM1(0003)] question[VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0100)]s right!
You understand Pokémon type matchups very well!
You have some understanding about Pokémon type matchups.

Oho... I see you’ve become the Champion. Then I can now have your Lv. 100 Pokémon undergo Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I have undergo Hyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR PKNICK(0001)] is already so strong, it doesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?
[VAR ITEM2(0000)]: [VAR NUM2(0001)]
Quit
The training starts now!
This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR sTRBAG(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR PKNICK(0000)] got stronger from the Hyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more Hyper Training?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?

Congratulations, Champion. Here, I’ve got a little something for you as celebration.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Magnolia! Why, you didn’t have to come all this way![VAR 0114(0008)]
After everything [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has achieved, it’s really the least I could do.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Wishing Stars that make Dynamaxing possible are parts of Eternatus. And when Eternatus was awakened, Dynamax energy flooded the entire region...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Because of that, Dynamax Pokémon were popping up all over, causing trouble across all of Galar. But [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser friends came to our rescue.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Dynamax phenomenon has long been an important part of Galarian culture. I hope everyone will use the power of Dynamaxing correctly in the days to come.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Please, do what you believe is best.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Poor Professor Magnolia... It seems she’s quite bothered by the chairman’s actions, since she helped carry out so much of the researching into Dynamaxing for him.[VAR 0114(0008)]

They can actually get pretty into it, so the performance might run pretty long! You still want to watch their concert?

Welcome to the Battle Café.
Hm? You’ve already battled today, haven’t you? Please come back tomorrow.
You can battle here once a day! If you win, we’ll give you a treat, on the house! Do you want to battle?
Okeydokey! Let’s have a break!
That was a battle as refreshing as a glass of Moomoo Milk!
That was a battle as exquisite as a glass of Lemonade!
That was a battle as smooth as a cup of Tapu Cocoa!
That was a battle as exciting as a glass of Pinap Juice!
That was a battle as elegant as a cup of Roserade Tea!
That was a battle as deep as some Komala Coffee!
Here is the treat I promised.
We have adopted the Double Battle rules here. Please come back with two or more Pokémon with you.
We look forward to your next visit.

You’re not interested in Rotom...? Really? Do such people even exist...?
Prepare to be confounded by all the various forms of my dear Rotom!
You defeated every one of my Rotom... You should be able to put this catalog to good use!
If you use the Rotom Catalog, it will let Rotom enter all sorts of home appliances! Oh, and of course, Rotom can get out again.

Evolution is a bit tricky for Pokémon Trainers... If a Pokémon evolves, it’ll get stronger, but its appearance will change. Do you want to know how to make your Pokémon strong without it evolving?
Oh, that’s too bad. If you change your mind, please come back.
OK. I’ll teach you while battling! Let’s have a Pokémon battle!
Even though my Dottler hasn’t evolved yet, it was hard to take down, wasn’t it? The secret is this Eviolite!
If you let a Pokémon that can still evolve hold this Eviolite, that Pokémon’s Defense and Sp. Def will go up!

Why, hello there, young man. Are you interested in weather?
Why, hello there, young lady. Are you interested in weather?
Oh, is that so! Well then, let me get started...
If the sunlight is harsh during battle...
Fire-type moves become more powerful, while Water-type moves are weakened!
The sunlight will thaw out any frozen Pokémon, and they’ll be immune to being frozen while the weather lasts, too!
Moves that use light, like Solar Beam, can be performed in one turn!
The effects of some other moves also get enhanced, like those of Growth and Synthesis.
Certain moves, like Thunder or Hurricane, become less accurate.
If it’s raining during battle...
Water-type moves will become more powerful, while Fire-type moves get weakened!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, also get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, moves like Thunder or Hurricane will become sure hits!
If it’s hailing during battle...
any Pokémon that’s not Ice type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, the move Blizzard will become a sure hit.
If a sandstorm is raging during battle...
Rock-type Pokémon get a boost to their Sp. Def!
Any Pokémon that’s not Rock, Ground, or Steel type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
Whew! I got a little carried away there!
Thanks for listening so politely. Please, take this!
You’re the first one to listen to everything I had to say about weather... Here’s a little something extra, just as a thank-you!

So, that means the culprit must be among us![VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait... Who are you?![VAR 0114(0042)]
After all the trouble of deducing things, don’t go messing it up now![VAR 0114(0042)]
*sigh* We’re accused of being criminals... Will you help us out?
I just want to be let go soon...
Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
*cough* I suppose I should introduce myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Howses. Yes, THAT Howses—the great detective. I’ve been hired by the hotel.[VAR 0114(006D)]
At present I have cornered the culprit of a most heinous crime.[VAR 0114(006D)]
And that crime is...[VAR 0114(006D)]
the strange case of who ate the large quantity of Berries in the lobby![VAR 0114(006D)]
I’ve gathered the three people who were present in the lobby at the time of the crime...[VAR 0114(006D)]
But because of the noise, my marvelous deductive reasoning seems somewhat muddled at present...[VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s it! You, interfering child! You will be my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Listen to the stories of each suspect, and find the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
Looks like you were unlucky enough to get caught up in this, too...
It was a huge pile of Berries in the lobby, right? There’s no way I could’ve eaten that many. I’ve been saying that this whole time.
That detective sure seems like trouble, doesn’t he?
I will admit that I saw the mountain of Berries, but my doctor told me to stop eating those things. I’ve got it in writing right here.
*sigh* Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
Huh? Berries? I didn’t eat them. Hey, you haven’t seen my Pokémon around here, have you?
Chewww!
Ah! My Pokémon! Where were you?
Muuunch.
It sure has a lot of Berry juice on its mouth...
Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(006D)]
After listening to everyone’s accounts, I have deduced the culprit.[VAR 0114(006D)]
Dancer! You are the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? Why me?
Because you’re a dancer! You move and shake your body so much that you needed all that food for extra energy![VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s evidence as clear and sharp as the leek of a Farfetch’d![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? What does that even mean? You’re no detective—you’re a fraud!
Wh-who are you calling a fraud?! You can’t be referring to me, the great detective![VAR 0114(006D)]
I can’t deal with this disrespect! I leave it to you! You find the culprit!
*gasp*[VAR 0114(006D)]
Fraud detective... It’s so cruel, I might cry...[VAR 0114(006D)]
You think I’m the criminal, too?!
You’re a fraud, too! A fraud assistant to a fraud detective!
Good, you get it.
What? You think I’m the culprit?
Sorry, but you’re totally wrong. I’ll do you a favor and keep that a secret. Let’s pretend that didn’t just happen, OK?
I can’t eat Berries, after all.
Wha?! You think I’m the culprit?
You’re wrong! Think things over more carefully!
Oh!
Cromch?
Could this be the culprit?
Munch...
What? That Skwovet is the one responsible?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Muuunch?
Ah, it’s true! It’s got Berry bits around its mouth!
Oh, you’re right. I see it now that I look more closely.
Yes, it definitely ate the Berries. Definitely...
Muuuncha.
As...[VAR 0114(006D)]
As... As expected of my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Here! Recompense for solving this mystery! Take it![VAR 0114(006D)]
Splendid, just splendid! I’m overjoyed![VAR 0114(006D)]
I must be off now. Take care, everyone![VAR 0114(006D)]
Hey, you! Wait just a minute!
Hahaha! I guess I’m supposed to chase after him, too.
Muuunchaaa!
Thanks for solving the case! Skwovet is saying you did good, too.

Tears are powerful... When I see them, I let my guard down without even noticing it. Do you want to use a TM that takes advantage of this power?
My rock music... It ignites men’s hearts! It brings women to tears! I don’t need fake tears.

What do you think about my secret beach? It’s a small mysterious paradise located on the very cool ocean. You’ve come all the way here, so I’ll give you a present.
The move Dive... Your Pokémon won’t be hit by attacks while it’s diving in the water. That’s right... It may be similar to my beach, which is so cold that nobody visits.
It certainly is a beach... But it’s just too cold!

H-hello there... You look like someone I might trust...
You see, there’s someone I fancy and I...I... I’ve written him a love letter!
Do you think you might deliver it for me?
Of course
Certainly not!
Oh, right... Sorry for asking such a strange thing of you...
D-did you change your mind, perhaps? Will you deliver my letter for me?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! I’m so glad I found someone like you to help me!
My name is Paula. Here you are. This is the letter I want you to deliver!
Deliver it to Frank for me, won’t you? Frank in Ballonlea. That’s who you want.
Please make sure the letter reaches Frank. Frank in Ballonlea. You’ll find him, won’t you?
Frank? That’s my grandda’s name.
You’re looking for Frank? That’d be me, yes...
What’s this? You’ve got a letter addressed to me?
You handed the Old Letter to the old man.
Now who could be sending me letters? Oh! Why, this says it’s from Paula!
That does take me back ages... Paula was the name of a girl I spent all my time playing with when I was a young lad...
She fell ill. Didn’t tell me, though. She kept it a secret just how sick she was.
We ended up having a great row about it... Then I moved away not long after that fight. I never met her again after the day I left.
How was she? Did she look well? Dear old Paula...
She looked well
... ... ...
That’s a comfort to hear.
What? The quiet type, are you? Meowth got your tongue?
I reckon I ought to give you something for this gift you’ve brought. For you’ve brought me back a piece of my youth.
Do you have a dear friend in your life? Make sure you treasure those dear to you while you have them close.
What’s this? You found something lying on the ground...
Finding your way through Glimwood Tangle is a fair sight easier if you give the mushrooms a li’l nudge to light them up.
Every time I meet granny Opal, she tells me I should wear more pink, the old bat.
My grandda seems to have a bit more spring in his step lately. Thanks for bringing whatever was in that letter!
Thank you...for delivering the letter...

Ta-da! You took the time to talk to a Poké Ball, so you deserve a little reward!
In case you were wondering, I’m not just any old Poké Ball! But then who am I, you ask? Well, the answer is simple. They call me the Ball Guy!
I’ll be rolling around stadiums here and there, so if you see me, don’t be shy! Come up and say hi!
Hi there, Champion! I’ve been waiting for you!
If I can become mates with the Champion, then maybe I can finally become the official mascot of the Gym Challenge...
Oh, before I forget! You were able to become Champion thanks to my cheers, right? So, here’s something to make sure you don’t forget your old friend Ball Guy!
A super-rare League Card! You’ll be the envy of every collector out there, I promise you!
Don’t worry about the card’s slight wrinkling. That’s just because everyone tried to get their hands on it! I know it looks like a common one, but mark my words—it’s a true treasure of a League Card!
Hello there! It’s your good friend Ball Guy! Don’t you worry—I’ll always make sure every Gym Challenger has a ball! It’s my duty as the volunteer mascot of the Gym Challenge!

I noticed something shiny on the ground while I was wandering the Wild Area, and so I went to investigate. Guess what I found? Star Pieces! A whole bunch of them! Here, you can have one, too!
You can sell Star Pieces for a good price at the Poké Marts. I’ve got my eye on some new clothes and a new hat already!

Ahhh... My delivery guy caught a cold and can’t make it today.
You’re the one who dined here with Chairman Rose, right? Would you please help us deliver some food?
Oh, sorry for asking something so strange.
Thank you! I truly appreciate it!
As for where to deliver the food... Sorry, I forgot to ask for an address.
I heard a clickety-clack sound from the phone. Maybe that’s a clue as to where to go?
Thanks for delivering the food. Here—something for your trouble.
Come back sometime for more work!
Back again? I wanted to ask you to deliver some food again. Is that OK?
I don’t know if this helps, but I think I heard a Pokémon cry over the phone. Like...
The customer told me to look for a green roof, but I wonder if there is such a house in Hulbury.
Thank you for taking care of all the deliveries. You really helped us out.
This is a little token of my gratitude. Please take it.
Welcome! Oh, it’s you. Please relax and stay as long as you’d like.
Oh, are you delivering my food? Thank you for your trouble! This restaurant’s dishes are full of seafood and so delicious!
I’ve already paid the restaurant, so I’ll give you candy as a tip!
For someone so young, you sure are a hard worker!
Ah! I’m starving! Oh, I can smell the ocean. You’re from the restaurant, aren’t you? I’ve been drooling while waiting for the food! Thank you for delivering the food!
You get energy from food! You should eat balanced meals!
You’re delivering food? Well, hey! I’m the one who ordered it! The tail curry of this restaurant has a unique flavor. I love it! Say hi to the manager for me!
It was easy to spot the green roof, wasn’t it?
Swiiirl.
You received the ordered food.
You handed over the ordered food.

Psst. Hey, you. You heard the rumor?
I have
I haven’t
Y-you have, huh? I mean, I don’t really care or anything...
What? You haven’t heard?!
There’s a rumor that if you give the one you like an Applin, you’ll be together forever!
Actually, the truth is, there’s someone I like.
She’s gonna move overseas pretty soon...
I’ve been searching for an Applin so I can get my feelings across the right way. But I can’t find one...
If you’ve got an Applin, would you please give it to me?
Oh, OK... Sorry to ask for something so weird. Guess I’ll look a little more on my own.
Whoa! You mean you’ll really give me an Applin?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] handed over Applin!
Wow! I did it! I finally got an Applin!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Since you went through the trouble of giving me an Applin...
I’ve got to tell her how I feel!
Sorry I’m late. What was it that you needed to talk about so suddenly?
I... Err... H-how’s your packing going?
Pretty much everything’s been packed.
Since I’m moving away tomorrow...
Yeah...
H-hey! Check out this Pokémon!
Oh, an Applin! Amazing! Did you catch it?
W-well...
N-no. Someone gave it to me.
I’m sorry! I really wanted to give you an Applin that I caught on my own! But, well...
Ah, just forget it! I can’t give you this Applin.
You’re right. I can’t take it.
Yeah...
Even if we’re separated and far away from each other...
I’ll still be waiting...for an Applin you caught yourself.
Wait—do you mean...?
Ah, um... I’ll, uh—I’ll see you later!
Say, what do you think that was about, just now? Do you think it meant that...?
Good on you!
Congratulations!
Th-thank you?
Wait! Does that mean what I think it means?!
Really, really?! I can’t believe it! Woo-hoo!
Ah, sorry! I just never thought that we both felt the same way.
Right, well, I’d better give this Pokémon back to you.
You got back your Applin!
Here, take this, too. Think of it as a reward for helping me take that first step.
I’m going to catch an Applin all by myself!
And then, someday, I’m going to go give her that Applin!
Yeah! I’d better get searching for an Applin!
Thanks again, mate. See ya!
Uh... I appreciate you wanting to help me out, but maybe you should make sure you actually have an Applin?

Electric Memory—on! This’ll help save on the electric bill!
Gumuuu?
Guess it really doesn’t work until Type: Null evolves. Drat...
Oh, Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. It probably goes without saying at this point, but congratulations on your victory!
To commemorate your achievements, I present you with this rare Pokémon—Type: Null!
Ah, and these, too.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received memories!
Once Type: Null evolves, its type will change depending on which memory you have it hold.
Ah, Champion! Are you taking good care of Type: Null?

Waaaaaah! My Minccino’s gone missing! What should I do?!
Can I help?
I don’t have time to help right now...
Waaaaaaaaah!
Huh? You’ll help me look for Minccino? Oh, thank you so much!
My Minccino really likes to play in the water, and it also likes the sound of whistling! I bet it’s hiding somewhere where there’s lots of water. But I can’t think of a place with lots of water here in Motostoke... It has a weird cry that sounds like “Mworp,” so if you hear that cry, try whistling!
[~ 6]
Mworp...?
It’s the missing Minccino!
Minccino went back to the boy.
[~ 10]
Minccino? No, I’m just an old man.
I come here secretly to freshen up, but I guess I’ve finally been found out!
Let me give you a little something to remember our meeting!
Now then, I must be on my way! Farewell! Ha ha ha ha!
The man went home!
That’s my Minccino!
Minccino came back! Thanks for helping me find it!
Please take this. It’s my way of saying thank you!
Minccino is my best friend. But it’s so full of energy, I can’t take my eyes off of it!

Oh... Champion. I never thought I’d run into you in the mines.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve been doing some voluntary community service on Mr. Rose’s behalf.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Mr. Rose... A long time ago he used to work in a coal mine, you know. That’s why I’m actually happy with doing this kind of work. Yes! I’m so happy, I think I’ll give you one of my prized League Cards![VAR 0114(0007)]
You don’t need to worry... I have a hundred copies of Mr. Rose’s League Card. They’re all signed, too![VAR 0114(0007)]

Yeah, you weren’t thirsty anyway.
But you can’t carry any more!
But you don’t have enough money!

Name’s Cara Liss. I am researching Fossils, huh.
Fossils in Galar are broken into top halves and bottom halves for some reason, huh. Strangely, no matter which top and bottom you combine, they can be restored together. Perhaps, within this mystery, lies the key to understanding these combinable Pokémon, huh.
Hm? You’ve got some Fossils there, huh. Will you show them to me, Cara Liss?
Don’t act so haughty.
Which of your Fossils do you think stands up to the high standards of Cara Liss?
Which of your Fossils do you think will pique the curiosity of Cara Liss?
Fossilized Bird
Fossilized Fish
Fossilized Drake
Fossilized Dino
Quit
So I should restore the [VAR ITEM2(0001)] and the [VAR ITEM2(0002)] together, huh?
Yes, please
I want to try something else
Quit
OK. Restoration time. Let’s unravel the mystery of these Fossils!
All right, I’ll stick ’em together! Here...we...GO!
Objective complete. It seems the restoration was a great success. Yes, I can see it in its eyes. This is a Pokémon that walked the face of Galar in ancient times! Please take and care for this Pokémon, huh.
Looks like there’s no room in your Boxes, huh.

[~ 4]

Maybe you’re a bit too strict? It doesn’t seem like you’re friends at all...
I guess you two just met? It’s still getting used to things.
Seems like it likes you an average amount! Don’t worry—you two will get closer as time passes!
Wow, I think you’re on your way to becoming real good friends!
Seems like you’re pretty good friends! Still, I bet you could become even closer!
You two get along great! Together is always better—am I right?
You two are almost best friends! I can see you really care about each other!
Oh wow, you’re best buddies! I can tell you’re so happy to be together!
Here, I’ll give you this as a sign of your friendship!
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] received a Best Friends Ribbon!

Hello there? What’s this? Did you need something from me? Riiight... Why don’t you run along for now, but come back when you’re as strong as a Champion, would you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, blow me over! You’ve become Champion? Now, that’s something worth writing home about![VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Morimoto. I’ve been waiting for a strong Trainer like you to come find me.
If you’ve got faith in your own skill, care to join me in a match?
Is that so? Well, that’s a right shame.
What’s this? Can’t battle if you don’t have at least two healthy Pokémon capable of joining in!
That’s the ticket! Now watch out! Because Morimoto’s got more than enough to motor right over you!
You’re really strong! I should’ve known!
Since you’ve managed to trounce me, I guess you’ve earned yourself a reward.
Let’s have ourselves a rematch someday!
You seem to keep motoring right over ol’ Morimoto. Let’s see who wins the next time!
I’m all tuckered out for today. How about tomorrow for a rematch?
And here [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she is! Ready for that match?
And...go! Awww, I missed again?! It’s harder than it looks to get a catch! Hmm? You... You look like you’d know the proper way to throw a Poké Ball!
I’m a planner! My job is think of ways to play, so I suppose that means that playing itself is my job!
Hear that background music? Yup, I made that!
We came here to research a bit. But the Galar region is lovely, isn’t it? The best part of all had to be enjoying the different toppings on all the curries. Curry is a big hit in Kanto, too, you know!
Do you like Pokémon?
Well, thanks for that! I hope you’ll always love them!
Oh, I get it... You don’t just like them. You love them, right?
I’m completely obsessed with Rotom Rally! I can’t get enough of it!

Well, look at you! You’re trying to complete the Pokédex, are you?
Thanks for that! Keep on searching out new Pokémon to catch!
Oh, I know! I’ve got just the thing to help you catch more and more Pokémon.
Come back and tell me when you’ve completed that Pokédex of yours!
It’s quite the task to complete a Pokédex. But I hope you won’t give up! If you do manage to complete yours, come and show it to me!
...A-amazing! You actually completed your Pokédex!
Congratulations! This is truly an amazing feat!
You deserve a special certificate to commemorate this champion achievement!
And I won’t stop there! Let me add a little something special to your League Card, too!
There we go!
And this is a little gift from me simply because you’ve made me so happy!
I hope your love for Pokémon doesn’t ever fade!
Congratulations again on completing that Pokédex of yours! Hehe! I’ll show you that beautiful certificate as many times as you like!
The Pokédex completion mark has been added to your League Card!

Thanks. Here’s your reward.
You handed over the [VAR ITEM2(0001)] and received [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)].
Oh, too bad...
Come back tomorrow, and I might have more for you to do, if you’re interested.
Oh, looks like you’ve become the Champion, huh, kid?
Oh, looks like you’ve become the Champion, huh, kid?
It’s hardly worthy of such an achievement, but here. Take this.
Come back again soon.
I dug up some mysterious items, but I’ve got no clue how they work. Maybe you could find some use for them, kid. Why don’t you take them?

Got some Pokémon questions? Feel free to ask away.
Undergo Hyper Training
Learn rare moves
Remember a move
Forget a move
Quit
Rate a nickname
Check a Pokémon’s memories
Well, come back anytime.
So, you’re the new Champion! I can put any of your Lv. 100 Pokémon through Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I put through Hyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR PKNICK(0001)] is already so strong, it doesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?

This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR PKNICK(0000)] got stronger from the Hyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more Hyper Training?
What move shall I teach?
Ultimate moves
Battle-combo moves
Quit
Back
Draco Meteor
Frenzy Plant
Hydro Cannon
Blast Burn
Fire Pledge
Water Pledge
Grass Pledge
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
Which Pokémon should I have remember a move?
Which Pokémon should I have forget a move?
Hm? This move is quite rare. If your Pokémon forgets this move, it won’t be able to relearn it. So I’ll teach it another rare move for you.
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] can’t learn my move.
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] already knows my move.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] learned [VAR MOVE(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
There are rare moves that your Pokémon can’t learn by leveling up or by using TMs or TRs! If you’re interested, I can teach them to your Pokémon.
You want one of your Pokémon to forget a move? If you want your Pokémon to use a move it’s forgotten, it’ll have to relearn the move first. So be careful.
I can have your Pokémon remember any move they should’ve had the chance to learn up until where they are now.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can forget.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can remember.
Huh? You can’t choose an Egg! It hasn’t even hatched yet!
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] has already learned the special move.
Would you like me to teach this move to another of your Pokémon?
Is there another Pokémon you’d like me to help remember some moves?
Would you like me to have your Pokémon forget any other moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon forget moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon remember moves?
Shall I stop teaching your Pokémon moves?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] has gained newfound determination and changed to its Resolute Form!

One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)] [VAR PKNICK(0000)] forgot [VAR MOVE(0002)]!

Which Pokémon’s nickname should I rate for you?
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)], is it? That is quite a fine nickname. But I think we could give it something even better. What do you think?
I see! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! You’re right—that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
[~ 77]
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is much better! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! That is a truly impeccable nickname! I can’t say anything bad about it! Take good care of [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg.
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a nickname and change back to the name that the Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. [VAR PKNAME(0001)]! It reminds you of the time when you first met the Pokémon! Come see me again if you want to give Pokémon nicknames.
For a Pokémon you got from another Trainer, you only get one go at changing its name. It’ll be [VAR PKNICK(0000)] from now on and forever. So you’re sure that’s the name you want?
All right. Let me know if you change your mind.
Shall I rate another Pokémon’s name?
Which Pokémon’s memories are you interested in?
Somehow I can tell what Pokémon remember.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] seems to have memories from its time with another Trainer.
Do you want to hear about the memories of any other Pokémon?
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] seems to have a fond memory, but it doesn’t seem to be able to remember the details...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] met [VAR TRNAME(0001)] [VAR 01D6(0002)]. [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0001)] threw a Poké Ball at it, and they started to travel together. [VAR 01D8(0007)] that [VAR 01D7(0006)].
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] hatched from an Egg and saw [VAR TRNAME(0001)] for the first time [VAR 01D6(0002)]. [VAR 01D8(0007)] that [VAR 01D7(0006)].

I sense great potential as a Trainer in you. But it’s still a bit early... Please come back when you become the Champion.
Eek! Champion! Do you want to teach your Pokémon the marvelous move [VAR MOVE(0001)]?
See you!
Oh, Champion. The Pokémon you are with right now can’t learn this move...
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach this move to?
Sorry. [VAR PKNICK(0001)] can’t learn this move.
An Egg can’t learn this move!
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] already knows this move!
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] learned [VAR MOVE(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)] [VAR PKNICK(0000)] forgot [VAR MOVE(0001)]! And it learned [VAR MOVE(0002)] instead![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
Steel Beam is an incredibly powerful move, but the user will take damage, too.

Hey there, Trainer! You’ve just taken your first step into the world of camping! People call me the Camping King! I can help you out with all your camping needs. Remember, everyone starts out as a rookie! If you’ve got any questions about camping, feel free to ask me!
Well, well! Today looks like another fine day for camping, I’d say!
Is there anything camping related you’d like some help with?
I want to change my tent color
Rate my Curry Dex, please
I want to change my cooking utensils
Feel free to ask me anything about camping!
I’ll pick out a color that goes well with your Pokémon!
Hmm. Hmm. Yes, I see... A color that would suit [VAR PKNICK(0000)]... That’s it! It must be the [VAR TYPE(0001)] type’s color!
Oho. Let’s see now... A color that suits your [VAR PKNICK(0000)]... Which do you think is a better fit?
Yes
No
[VAR TYPE(0000)]-type color
[VAR TYPE(0001)]-type color
The [VAR TYPE(0000)]-type color? Are you sure?!
I’ve changed your tent to the [VAR TYPE(0000)]-type color!
Oh? Why, you haven’t made a single dish yet! Come back after you’ve tried making one, and show me!
You’ve reached the highest heights of curry creation! I have nothing more to teach you! Continue to strive for curry creation excellence!
How’s your Curry Dex coming along? Allow me to have a quick look at it. Looks like you’ve made [VAR NUM3(0001)] kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s of curry!
You’re still a camping rookie! For starters, why not try throwing any ingredients you like in the pot and see what comes of it!
Looks like you’re getting the hang of cooking while out camping. Try adding in Berries to your curry to give it a little extra oomph!
With ten curries under your belt, I think you’ve graduated from rookie status! Keep trying to create all manner of wonderful curries from here on out!
You’ve certainly started making your way down the long road of curry cooking! Be sure to fan the flames just right, so as not to burn the dish. And don’t spill anything when stirring the pot!
Oh! Why, you’ve made at least thirty different kinds of curry! I can feel the curry creation potential radiating from you! Keep doing your best to aim for higher and higher heights!
Seems like making curry has become a common part of your everyday life by now, right? Remember you can always buy more ingredients, as well as find them lying on the ground! Gather as many different ingredients as you can and make all different kinds of curry!
You stand now among the curry cooking elite! You probably already know this, but if you cook in someone else’s camp, there’s a chance you’ll be able to use an ingredient that wasn’t in your Bag!
That look on your face! That faint fragrance of some spice! You’ve become a truly splendid curry chef! I bet there are times you look through your Curry Dex and relive all the memories that fill it!
You’ve made every single curry I know of?! Amazing...simply amazing! You may very well complete your Curry Dex before even I do!
Oh? Oh?! Could this be? Can this truly be?! You’ve...you’ve completed your Curry Dex! You’ve made every known curry in this world to date! To have come so far in your camp cooking... I’m touched! Truly touched! Thank you!
Since you’ve made at least [VAR NUM3(0000)] different kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s of curry, how about a reward?
You put [VAR 1300(0001,0000)][VAR sTRBAG(0001)] away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Fresh Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Weighted Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Soothe Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Mirror Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Tympole Ball away in your Camping Gear.
You put the Champion Ball away in your Camping Gear.
Sausages are a staple topping! Be sure to try cooking with them!
This Fresh Ball is a new kind of Poké Ball I’ve developed... Nah, I’m just having a laugh! It’s a toy you can use to play with your Pokémon while camping. It’s the spitting image of a Watmel Berry, and it’s quite heavy, too. You might have a little difficulty throwing it!
Remember, a Heavy Ball is what you use to catch Pokémon! This might look similar, but it’s a Weighted Ball... It’s just a toy! It makes a real heavy sound as it bounces! Try playing with it when camping with your Pokémon!
The Soothe Ball makes a sound like a bell when you throw it! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon to calm everyone’s hearts!
The Mirror Ball is ultra-reflective and the pinnacle of funkiness! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon to get everyone pumped up!
The Tympole Ball looks like...well...Tympole. You can hear Tympole’s cute cry when the ball bounces on the ground!
The Champion Ball is a kind of gag gift with Leon’s face on it! Try throwing it when you’re camping with your Pokémon. Leon’s face will fly far and bounce with some impressive oomph!
Moomoo Cheese melts in a curry and makes a dish taste even better! Cooking with it will also help you add some new entries to your Curry Dex. So try using this ingredient next time you cook!
Everyone knows Slowpoke Tails are a delicacy! They fall off all the time and grow back quickly, so they’ve become a popular cooking ingredient! Adding it to a curry is sure to create a taste that you’ll fall in love with!
Ah, another thing...
Thank you for completing your Curry Dex! You’ve truly accomplished something marvelous! And such a cook deserves an appropriate set of cooking utensils. Please take these!
You received the golden cooking utensils!
You’re using the golden cooking utensils right now. Would you like to change back to the normal ones?
You’re using normal cooking utensils right now. Would you like to change to the golden ones?
You changed to the normal cooking utensils!
You changed to the golden cooking utensils!
Fresh Ball
Weighted Ball
Soothe Ball
Mirror Ball
Tympole Ball
Champion Ball
No, thanks
All right, then we’ll leave your tent as its current color!
All right! We’ll leave things as they are!
Hm? Your tent is already the [VAR TYPE(0000)]-type color.
First, I’ll tell you about the mysterious dish called curry. Everyone in Galar has been hooked on it! To start, you need to mix in a Berry to make the curry! Then you cover a grain called “rice” in it! And there you have it! It’s quite literally curry with rice! But wait! There are ingredients that you can add to the dish, like toppings to better suit your tastes! You can make all sorts of magnificent curries while you’re camping!

You want to know if your Pokémon have really been giving it their best effort?
Oh, I see...
That Pokémon...
Yeah! It looks like it can still give a bit more!
This one really gave it their all! I’ll give them something as a symbol of all their hard effort.
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] got an Effort Ribbon!
That Effort Ribbon looks good on your Pokémon!

Welcome, Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! The tournaments here are always open to you, of course! Give one a try, won’t you?
Welcome, Champion! Would you like to take part in a tournament?
Understood! Perhaps next time, then!
Is there a particular Trainer you’d like to invite to take part in the tournament today?
There is someone...
No one in particular
Who would you like to invite to take part?
Next
Quit
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]
You’d like to invite [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?

Very good! It looks like your invitation has been accepted! I’ll take you through to the pitch now. And good luck!
Congratulations on another victory! Please take your reward!
We look forward to your next visit!
Well, that’s a rather disappointing outcome... But you’ll get ’em next time, Champion! We look forward to your next visit!
You’re on a real roll, Champion! Let me offer my ultra-great congratulations!
I’m really feeling bowled over here... So here! Take this and have a ball battling!

I found this three days ago, but I’ll give it to you!
Though...use caution, you know? It is at least three days old, after all.
I don’t know how this ended up in my pocket... so here—why don’t you take it!
The question is...how did it get in my pocket?
I was just walking along when this fell on me from above... Why don’t you take it?
After all, I’ve only got painful memories of it... hitting me on the head, that is.
I stumbled upon this buried in the ground. Why don’t you have it?
I don’t plan on being tripped up in my journey, so better you to take it than me!
A wild Pokémon was holding this when I caught it. Take it!
Do you think Pokémon like these things, too?
I found something amazing just now. Think I’ll give it to you!
It’s amazing, so you’d better take proper care of it and not lose it!
Do you know if there’s anything to find over yonder?
Seeing all this wide, open space...simply makes you want to run wild, doesn’t it?
I’m gonna find loads of Pokémon!
Hey, fancy meeting you again! Hope you’re doing well.
[~ 54]
[~ 55]
[~ 56]
I’m crazy strong and flush with cash! Why won’t anyone battle me?! How about you? Dare to take me on?
You’re crazy strong, too! I’ll teach you a good trick then. There are heaps of items lying around the Wild Area that people have dropped! Go around picking them up and then selling ’em off, and you can be flush with cash, too!
I’ll work on getting even stronger yet, so come find me for another battle sometime!
Ahhh! Winning makes me feel generous, so I think I’ll teach you a good trick! There are heaps of items lying around the Wild Area that people have dropped! Go around picking them up and then selling ’em off, and you can be flush with cash, too!
Hey there! I found a bit of a rare item here in the Wild Area. You want it? Only [VAR NUM1(0000)] W!
Looks like we have a deal! I hope it helps you out a bit on your adventure!
You enjoying the Wild Area? You know some items are easiest to get through Max Raid Battles, right?
Hahaha! I guess it does sound a bit suspect when you stop to think about it, eh? But if you change your mind, you know where to find me!
I fished up something brilliant! This is absolutely...brilliant! Want my brilliant find for a brilliant bargain of just [VAR NUM4(0000,002C)] W?!
Well, that was a brilliant choice you just made! Then here you are! As promised!
Think I’ll fish myself up another brilliant find!
Whaaat?! What a brilliant blunder for you...
All right. Snap to it. Let the battle begin!
Oh, yes? Right then. Right shame that is.
You don’t have enough Watts, pal... Try checking out any glowing dens you find to gather up some more!
You don’t have enough brilliant beaming Watts! You’d better hurry, or I might hook a better deal!
There’s energy pouring out from the den!
There’s a bit of energy trickling out of the den...
You obtained [VAR NUM5(0000,002C)] W!
Heya, all right? We two brothers are known as the Digging Duo! We’re digging up treasure here, see?
You’ve got a fair bit of luck finding us here! If you’d like to spot us some Watts, we’ll dig you up some handy treasures for your adventure!
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of stamina, but when it comes to skill, my brother’s the best! Want me to dig you up some treasure? It’ll only cost you [VAR NUM5(0001,002C)] W! And a wee saving of your progress, too.
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of skill, but when it comes to stamina, my bro’s the best! Want me to dig you up some treasure? It’ll only cost you [VAR NUM5(0001,002C)] W! And a wee moment to save your progress, too.
Thanks for your support! Then I’ll dig up all I can for ya!
Thanks for your support! Then I’ll dig up the best find I can for ya!
That right? Sure, sure. But no need to be shy. Come ask us anytime!
That right? Sure, sure. Come visit us again anytime, though!
Bingo! It’s [VAR iCOLOR2(0000,0000)][VAR sTRBAG(0000)]!
Should I keep digging, then?
Yeah? Probably wise. I’ve still got some petrol in the ol’ tank, though.
Phew! I’m all tuckered out... I guess that’s probably it for this dig!
I managed to dig up [VAR NUM3(0000)] treasure[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s this time. Take good care of [VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0402)]itthem!
Oh? What... You haven’t got the Watts! If you want more Watts, maybe try searching out some Pokémon Dens and looking into them!
Wait! No! I’m not finished yet! I can still keep on digging!
Dig for me!
I’m good
What’s your best record?
My greatest record is [VAR NUM3(0000)] treasure[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s in one go. Told you I wasn’t lacking in stamina, eh?
My greatest record is [VAR NUM3(0000)] treasure[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s in one go. Told you I wasn’t lacking in skill, eh?
Whoa?! Feast your eyes on this one! This is a mighty rare find, you jammy thing!
You! Yes, you! You’ve got Pokémon with you, haven’t you? You camp with them, don’t you? And you cook alongside them, right? Delicious curries will cure them of whatever ails them, you know! And you can get Berries to cook up curries at trees like that one right there! Yes, right there! And if you want more ingredients, talk to me! I’ll sell you all my freshest finds for real cheap!
How are you doing, young friend? Would you like me to help see you to the next town?
To Motostoke, please!
To Hammerlocke, please!
No, thanks
[~ 102]
Then simply leave it to me!
Here we are! And when you’ve trained up a bit, give the Wild Area another chance, would you? She’s got some fine secrets, she does.
If your Pokémon are ever getting a bit ragged out here, set up camp and cook them up a nice meal to have them feeling better in no time.
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “The large Pokémon you see wandering around in the Wild Area are strong! “If you try battling one and it seems like you’re in over your head, try to run! Run like the wind!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “Cooking at your camp can restore HP to your Pokémon, and even the PP they need to use their moves over and over! “Pokémon that have fainted and can’t battle any longer will perk right up as well with a piping hot plate of curry before them! “Visit Berry trees to collect plenty of Berries, so you can always make more curries!”
Hi there! Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Thanks for stopping by! Would you like to buy anything before you go?
On your way to Motostoke? If you are, you’ll find it just up over that rise and to the east! Once you find the walls of the city, just follow them till you reach the stairs!
Isn’t there anyone who wants to come join me for a Max Raid Battle? If only people would let me know on Y-Comm, I’d have them join me in a heartbeat!
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “Use the Right Stick to rotate the camera when you’re in the Wild Area! “And if you press the Right Stick, you’ll find you can see a wider view of things! “Press the L Button to look straight ahead again!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here? “The Wild Area is overflowing with a special sort of energy, measured in Watts! “You can gather Watts yourself from glowing Pokémon Dens and glowing Pokémon in the wild! “You’ll also find Trainers in the Wild Area who are willing to give you all sorts of items if you’ll just give them some of your Watts!”

I’m the game director! The Rotom Dex is pretty fun, isn’t it? If you manage to fill in some of your Pokédexes, come and show me, would you?
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Whoa! You’ve registered all the Pokémon that can be found on Melemele Island!
You did it! Congratulations! You completed the Melemele Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Yikes! You’ve gone and found all the Pokémon for Akala Island!
Amazing! Congratulations! You completed the Akala Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Oho! You’ve got every Pokémon that can be found on Ula’ula Island here!
That’s just like you! Congratulations! You completed the Ula’ula Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! I know what that face means! That’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex! Let’s see what you’ve done... Oh, wow! You’ve registered all the Pokémon for Poni Island!
That’s superb! Congratulations! You completed the Poni Pokédex!
I’m the game director! Oh! Now what is that invigorating expression you’ve got on your face? Could it be? Are you here to show me a Pokédex? ... ... ... Oh! Whoooaaa! No way! You’ve completed the entire Alola Pokédex! It’s amazing! Amaza-laz-a-ling! You’re too much! Cannot compute!
This is really truly an astounding feat! Congratulations on completing the Pokédex!
Phew! There! I’m glad I didn’t mess up the stamp. And...it looks like your Trainer Passport leveled up, too! Come see me again anytime if you manage to fill in another Pokédex!
Phew! There! I may have stamped that one a bit harder than necessary, but I couldn’t seem to help it! I feel honored that I get to help a great Trainer like you celebrate your achievement!
I’m the game director! Hey, it’s you again! The master of the Alola Pokédex! Now that you’ve filled in your entire Pokédex, have fun visiting lots of different facilities and places with your Pokémon. Enjoy Alola! And get along with your Rotom Dex, too! Thanks again for playing!
I’ll go ahead and give you a new stamp to commemorate completing a Pokédex! Here we go! Bam!
All right, then! I’m going to give your Trainer Passport the super-special stamp I’ve been holding back this whole time! Here we go! Bam!
I really want to reward you somehow for your mastery in Pokédexing! Let’s see what I can dig out of my pocket... Boy, I feel like a Picker-Upper! My Secret Base was Gold Rank, by the way. And...ta-da! It’s a Shiny Charm! Just having one of these makes it more likely that you’ll encounter Shiny Pokémon!
And that’s not all! Here’s a little something special that would go well on a tireless Trainer like you, who’s been running all around Alola to fill your Pokédex!
You received a set of the Karate Gi Jacket and Karate Gi Pants!
And that’s not all! Here’s a little something special that would go well on a veteran Trainer like you, who learned Alola inside and out to fill up your Pokédex!
You received a set of a Pokémon Center Nurse Cap, a Pokémon Center Nurse Top, and a Pokémon Center Nurse Skirt!

Ranked Battles let you compete with Pokémon Trainers all over the world.
It’s nerve-racking to battle against Trainers all over the world. That’s why you should learn every possible way to battle at the Battle Tower.
Leon...he transformed Rose Tower into the Battle Tower when he became its owner. He’s no longer the Champion, but he really wants to make everyone strong! I admire him!
I’ll keep battling and steadily raise my rank!

It’s a mailbox that Pokémon collect letters from!
There are so many books! The ad says the magazine with a special feature on all the Gym Leaders is the most popular.
It’s a record shop. Apparently you can find some rare records here.
[~ 22]
[~ 23]

[~ 25]
This city is just massive! I need to keep checking my Town Map, otherwise I know I’ll get lost!
Here in the Galar region, I’d say it’s fair to call the Champion a regional hero. We’re all transfixed by everything he does!
You gotta throw Poké Balls! Throw them over and over to get your pitching technique sorted!
Leon throws his Poké Balls with so much energy! I wonder if the Pokémon inside get dizzy?
Churu churu.
[~ 31]
It’s wonderful that there’s space for Steenee to relax and enjoy itself. In fact, I’m tempted to join it and quench my thirst, too!
We use the Pokémon move Growth to raise our flowers, so they get rather large!
I always bring flowers home—on special days or even normal days. My Pokémon loves the scent of flowers so much.
I love flower Pokémon!
Shrinking down to fit in Poké Balls, and the next thing you know, growing massive by Dynamaxing... It must be a lot of work for Pokémon!
Minci minci minci!
Minccino likes things neat and tidy. It’ll brush away any dust with its tail!
I see that you’re working on a Pokédex! You’ll meet lots of different Pokémon if you head to the Wild Area.
There’s something satisfying about actually being able to hold the products when you shop. Then again, buying things online and having Pokémon deliver them to you has its own charm.
You can really tell a person’s character by going shopping with them. My husband...well...he doesn’t think too much about what he buys.
Grrrarock!
Onix is big, but it can get even bigger by Dynamaxing!
Howzit? I came all the way from Alola to watch the Gym Challenge in person!
If I could choose my own uniform number, which one should I pick? I can’t make up my mind!
I can’t wear the same uniform as my favorite Gym Leader. I’d get way too nervous.
Records truly are amazing. They bring life back to singers who no longer can sing...
Mr. Rose has a real love for the Galar region. It’s not enough to help keep us all supplied with energy—he even supports the Gym Challenge!
Steam power’s amazing! It can even move that giant lift!
I’m always frightened by airplanes and whatnot... How those giant chunks of metal move so fast. Pokémon don’t bother me, though.
I never get tired of watching those giant, steam-powered gears turning!
My Toxel likes tinned food way too much.
There are some Pokémon that just love to battle. I guess there’s lots of different ways to live with Pokémon!
It’s fun playing with Mandibuzz, but really I wish I could fly with it!
Buafuah!
Poen poen.
Come on now, Tympole. Time to head home.
In the Galar region, it’s only natural that we help each other out. The cleaning I do is just volunteer work!
Even if there’s no point in having a chin-wag, it’s still great to hear the voice of someone you like!
People can change whenever they want—they just need to want to change... Maybe this old man can make a change, too.
Pokémon need PP, or Power Points, to perform moves!
It’s fine and dandy to have battles in the city, but you need to make sure you don’t get in anyone’s way!
I’m playing hopscotch with Wynaut and my younger sister! Do you know hopscotch? You have to jump your way through the court!
We can play with our Pokémon here!
Wy wynaut.
Once I get my new hairstyle, I’m going to stop by the Rotomi at the Pokémon Center to update my League Card!
I do my best every day and cheer on my favorite Gym Leaders... You really don’t get tired of doing the things you love!
Some people say they like Pokémon because of how strong they are, but I think that their cuteness is part of their appeal, too!
The Gym Challenge is a journey, you know. You travel throughout the region, together with your Pokémon. Remember, if you were able to take the first step, the second step is never quite as hard.
I know old folks like us can get carried away offering advice, but the most important thing for young ones like you is to live the way you want.
Mworp!
Well? What do you think about our secret hideout? We want to make a new Gym!
I bet we would make it the best Gym in Galar in like two years!
The Gym Leaders battle each other separately from the Gym Challenge in order to determine who is stronger.
Don’t you wish people could use Pokémon moves, too? I mean, I bet I could unleash an amazing Hyper Beam!
Most of the companies here in Galar are owned by Chairman Rose!
My favorite person is the Champion! My favorite word is “strongest”!
Ah, Motostoke Stadium! This is where the opening ceremony is held! Exhibition matches are super exciting, too!
You’re participating in the Gym Challenge? I bet you have some dependable Pokémon, then.
You’ve got the Fire Badge! That’s wicked, mate!
The Gym Leaders will show up for the Gym Challenge opening ceremony.
You’re a challenger, right? Don’t let those Gym Leaders beat you!
I was watching your match! I literally shouted with excitement when you defeated Kabu!
The stadium is so huge! I wonder how many houses would fit inside?
The stadium can even handle Dynamax Pokémon battling inside! It is said that long, long ago there was a giant stadium made entirely out of stone.

I feel like that challenger named Bede has some potential! I bet he’ll pull off something incredible!
My favorite is Leon’s Charizard!
Everyone participating in the Gym Challenge is welcome to stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
We League staff are here to provide support for the various matches that occur throughout the Gym Challenge.
Go, Gym Challenger! Looking forward to it!
Do your best!
I’m cheering for you!
Give it your best shot!
Yeah! So cool!
Go! Go all the way! Just keep going!
Oh! You’re that challenger everyone’s talking about.
You’re gonna face Kabu? Well, good luck!
Kabu’s a strong Trainer. That’s for sure!
Go all out!
All the Gym Leaders... right here!
You’re an amazing Trainer, defeating Kabu and all!
[~ 103]
Great weather, eh, mate?
I can’t believe Kabu lost! What a match!
Hey, Champion! Thanks for everything!
Good day to you!
Hey there! That was a good match!
I heard Kabu’s training his team all over again.
Something good happen?
I wish something good would happen.
Guess I should go look for something good.
That meal was a delight!
Time for some Max Raid Battles in the Wild Area!
I can’t find the TR that I really want...
The Gym Challenge! The Gym Challenge!
I want to battle Leon!
Where’d Leon go?
Cooking while camping is just fantastic!
Curry’s kind of like stew, right?
I hear curry’s really popular in places like Kanto.
It’s so soothing to see Pokémon playing in the city.
My hobby’s going camping and playing with Pokémon!
I bet I could become a camping master!
Oh! You’re the Gym Challenger I’m cheering for!
I’m gonna buy the uniform of my favorite Gym Leader!
Your uniform number is super popular!
Pardon.
Yeah, that makes sense.
That’s about right.
Speed is important! It lets you attack first!
TMs are great! They never break!
The Rotom Rally! The Rotom Rally!
Poké Balls! Great Balls!
Ultra Balls are ultra-great!
Master Balls are a sure catch!
Dynamaxing makes your Pokémon become huge!
Gigantamaxing changes your Pokémon’s look!
You can win a Master Ball through the Loto-ID.

A Gym Challenger! Ah, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu, you’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in Turffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger! And you’ve even earned your first two Badges! But I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to Galar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special training with his team. You might want to head there to try to catch him.
Oh? A bit late for challenging the Gym tonight, wouldn’t you say? Come again tomorrow. If you need a place to pass the night, all Gym Challengers can stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
Let’s all do our utmost as Gym Challengers.
First stop will be Turffield, eh? I’m off for Route 3 myself!
I’ve made it this far, at least... But now I’m not sure I can make it any further. Can I really beat the Fire Gym? I don’t know...
Your Pokémon really got stuck in and did [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0503)]itstheir best for you, didn’t [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0402)]itthey... When I watched your match, I was the one who ended up feeling fired up to carry on!
The opening ceremony of the Gym Challenge... My whole family’ll be watching back home... I should go check my hair once more in the mirror, don’t you think?
Getting to see Chairman Rose address us all like that... I’ve never been so fired up in my life!
I got the Grass Badge and the Water Badge... But can I really get a Fire Badge?
You beat that Kabu fellow?! You really are a great Trainer... At this rate, I bet the other Gym Challengers will start wanting to test their mettle against you.
I heard that this year’s Gym Challengers include Trainers that were endorsed by the chairman and even the Champion!
Collecting all eight Gym Badges... It feels a bit like a treasure hunt, doesn’t it? I wonder how hard the battles will be against the Gym Leaders, though.
You’re one of those Gym Challengers that were endorsed by Leon, right? No wonder you’re up to taking on Kabu.
That’s Leon for you, isn’t it... He must’ve seen at a glance how much potential you had, and that’s why he chose to endorse you.
I’m dead nervous, and this is only the opening ceremony... What’s the matter with me?! My Pokémon all seem to be aching to battle, so why can’t I seem to feel the same way...?
I got to stand on the pitch in a stadium, just like I’ve always dreamed of doing... Next up, I’ll be battling on that pitch! No! Winning on that pitch—as the crowd goes wild!
There are heaps of us starting out like this, but only a small number will make it to the end...
Just seeing the Champion is a dream come true. But my real dream ought to be to defeat him!
Finally, the time’s come for another Gym Challenge!
Time to train up my team out on Route 3!
I’m ready for that Fire Gym Leader Kabu!
We’re not done yet. Let’s give it our all!
Everyone’s already nervous. Will we make it to the end?
I’m going to make it to the end of this—just you watch!
There are still a number of challengers in the running!
That Gym Challenger’s done better than I ever dreamed!
Hmm. So everyone here is a fellow Gym Challenger...
Everyone’s going to be competing to win this.

I saw the ruins at Stow-on-Side, but... I don’t really get art sometimes...
She keeps going on about art, but really all that matters is whether you like what you see or not.

Not too many Gym Challengers make it all the way to Raihan... I really wish we could see more matches with him and his Pokémon.
Opal’s been a Gym Leader for several decades— the very definition of a seasoned veteran... I doubt you’ll stand a chance.
Chairman Rose himself once participated in the Champion Cup. He really took off after the Semifinals!

I cross the bridge one way feeling anticipation for the match I’m going to watch, and then I cross the bridge the other way feeling excited after seeing an amazing match!
We can just walk to the stadium, but challengers have to win if they want to reach it...
I wonder how many houses would fit inside Wyndon Stadium?!
You never know the weather until you wake up. You never know who will win until it’s done.
Everybody in the world watches the same match. That means everybody in the world can talk to each other about that same match!
Great matches will always be remembered by the crowd!
Kantonians and Galarians both seem to like waiting in lines...
Get your official merchandise here! We also have League Cards!
I came looking for rare League Cards, but they’re all sold out!
Today’s weather is perfect for a match! I mean, I say that for any weather, and the stadium has a roof, but still.
Would you care for some Pokémon snacks or Pokémon drinks?
I wasn’t thirsty at all, but all these juices look so good that now I feel parched!
Challengers are just too amazing... Any mistake they make is seen by tens of thousands of fans, but the challengers just keep on battling as if it were nothing. They must all have nerves of steel!
He says he likes someone who’s fun to be with, even when they’re eating their usual food.
I think the reason why we feel restaurant food is so much better than normal food is because of the novelty of it all.
We’ll show you the full power of Team Yell!
We’re gonna stay out of trouble this time. I mean, we want to watch the matches, too!
[~ 62]
I’m not gonna go into the stadium just yet. I want to enter it as a challenger!
Welcome, Challenger! Please, battle to your heart’s content!
Time for the final match... Everyone’s got their eyes on you!
That was the best match I’ve ever seen!
Welcome, Challenger! Please, battle to your heart’s content!
This might be the first time we see a Trainer defeat Leon.
I...I’m speechless... That was just...amazing...
Leon, Leon, the greatest Champion ever! ♪ Leon, Leon, will he be beaten? Never! ♪
My sister just keeps singing Leon’s cheering song!
Charizard’s Max Flare is different from any other Pokémon’s!
I won’t lie—I started cheering for Leon because my child is a huge fan.
I’m taking as many pictures as I can. They’re like little slices of time.
I feel like my Pokémon always smiles when we take photos together.
Cheeez!
I’ve got my eyes set on Wyndon Stadium!

Cheers!
Nothing like a good match to spice up your day.
Amazing matches make me want to work hard, too!
Much obliged.
Much obliged!

Good day!
Kids have their whole future ahead of them!
The future’s in your hands, Champion!
I can’t wait to see Dynamax Pokémon!
Being able to see Pokémon Gigantamax is the best!
So, Sonia’s finally decided to become a professor, eh?
The Champion’s match!
Oh man, I can’t believe Hop lost...
I love Leon, but I love the new Champion, too!
So many people! It’s a little intimidating...
People from all over the world gather here, huh!
The Galar region’s growing on me.
I always bring up the weather when meeting new people...
I can’t stop myself from saying what’s on my mind.
There were Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald after all!
I train myself together with my Pokémon!
The important thing about training is to never give up.
A strong will is the secret to becoming a strong Trainer!
Yaaay! I’m a Charizard!
I’m gonna Dynamax someday!
I swear I’ll beat the Champion!
This city’s huge... Let me check my Town Map.
Even kids can ride the Flying Taxis!
I like the monorail, too. I think it’s kinda cute!
There must be at least one ninja around here...
Was there a Pokémon that was like a ninja?
Maybe I’ll challenge the Champion myself!
I’ve got my Charizard pose down pat!
I feel a new Champion is about to be born!
I need to get all the official merchandise!
At last! The final match!
The final showdown... This is so exciting!
Hey, it’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Strong and noble! [VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)] is the best!
I’m cheering for you both! Show us a good match!
Go on! Show us what you can do!
Please! Can I have an autograph?!
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
If you want to get around Wyndon, you’ve come to the right Flying Taxi, guv’nor! Where’d you like to go?

You got it, guv! Let’s get moving, Corviknight!
Aw, that’s too bad. Well, let me know if you ever need a ride!
All right, guv, here we are! Just come to me if you need a ride again!
Talkin’ to me ain’t gonna help you find the bad guy, now is it? I’ll cheer you on, so go out there and track him down![VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara!
So there are good League staff members, and then there’s this bad League staff member, and the only difference is that the bad one is wearing sunglasses? Why even bother with the different look, then?
If I were this bad League staff member, I’d just lose the sunglasses...
We’re crazy busy because of the Champion Cup, and yet I can’t get to Rose Tower... Some League staff aren’t doing their jobs!
There are some League staff that’ve gone and started up a fan club dedicated to Ms. Oleana...
I’ve heard that the Champion and Chairman Rose are having a very important discussion right now... I wonder what it’s all about?
It’s finally time for the Champion Cup! Being super busy makes you want to slack off, doesn’t it?
I want to get to Rose Tower but the monorail isn’t moving...
There’s no sign of that bad League staff! Where’d they go?!
I’m looking for something to look for!

Everyone should wear costumes! Then we’d all be best friends with our Pokémon!
I wonder if they have any costumes that look more like the Pokémon they’re supposed to be?
I really wanted a kid’s size version of Leon’s cape, but they’re all sold out...

I can’t remember where I saw them, but I’m debating whether I should go with a hairstyle like a sword or a shield...
If you win, it’s time for a makeover! If you lose, it’s also time for a makeover... It’s all about your mood.
Each Pokémon has a different type of fur, so I’ve got a lot to learn!

Welcome to the Rose of the Rondelands. We pride ourselves on offering five-star service that is beloved throughout the world.
I’m a professional concierge! I’m more than happy to assist Pokémon...even if we don’t speak the same language!
It’s important to always be smiling! My legs are feeling a bit swollen, though...
I came to Galar on my Braviary instead of my private jet, but I must admit it was a little tiring...
I know my wife is complaining, but she actually loves traveling with her Pokémon.
I was invited by Macro Cosmos to come watch the matches.
A celebrity watching any match is sure to get everyone interested.
Being a doorman is a lot of work! It doesn’t matter how many people come and go, mistakes are unacceptable. That’s why we have Pokémon helping us out, too.
Weeeeeelcoooooome.

The Champion’s been a great boon to Trainers. The sport has really taken off, thanks to him. Plenty of Trainers see his matches and get fired up thinking, “I’d like to be like him.”
It’s like a global festival whenever the tournaments or the Champion Cup are on! People and Pokémon come from all over!

It can seem a wee bit harsh, having it broadcast for all to see whether you’ve won or lost. But it’s also a fine chance to understand exactly how strong you are, if you care to.

Maybe I should go and have some Max Raid Battles in the Wild Area before the match starts...
I’m training so that I can become huge too and help defeat Dynamax Pokémon.
I can do jobs that Pokémon can’t do! For example... Uh, I don’t know... But I’m sure there’s something I could do!
Well, you see, we depend entirely on Pokémon that come to us for the Poké Jobs at our hotel.
Palpitoad, you’ve had too much to eat! Are you OK?
Gleh bleeeeeeh...
So many people in the city! I got lost, but thank goodness for the Flying Taxi!
Even if you get lost, it’s fun to reach your destination by using the Town Map!

Wyndon is quite massive, so it can be a frightful headache to find your way around. Best to use the monorail or ring up a Flying Taxi.
[~ 1]
[~ 2]
We get heaps of tourists here in Wyndon, so I change up the menu to cater to their tastes.
You get so caught up in the action of the matches when you’re in the stadium that you forget to eat!
I want to do an entire loop of the Galar region! What better way to start than the Ferris wheel?
A Ferris wheel... But I’m afraid of heights!
So according to this, you can’t reach Rose Tower unless you take the monorail...
Certain Pokémon species love the train rails... They can cause rather amusing trouble at times!
You can see one of Wyndon’s famous monorail platforms right this way! The monorail goes round and round the city! It’s a dizzying delight!
Ki dee dee!
My Pokémon love music more than just about anything else! When they hear anything with a sick beat, they can’t stand still. They’re off like a shot!

Hiya! Me and my little sister have set ourselves up as a pop-up Pokémon Center service. Not that we asked anyone if we could or should. Galar Mine is pretty rough on a team, isn’t it? I’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, friend.
Come talk to me anytime you think your team needs a bit of care!
Welcome to our pop-up Pokémon Center! You want your team healed up again?
Thanks for waiting! Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] should be all better now!

Why does Spikemuth have its shutter down? Are they having a party in there?
What’s this? The earth is shaking?! Maybe if I try to sway in the same way... Nope, not helping!
[~ 2]
The Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, specializes in Dark-type Pokémon. He’s a decent bloke, though.
That cape with all the logos... Was that the Champion running by?!
With the shutter down, nobody’s going to be able to attempt the Gym Challenge.
I hope everything is OK in Hammerlocke...
All this red light! Is it Dynamax light?
How? How can wild Pokémon Dynamax when we’re nowhere near a Power Spot?
The Champion and Charizard are superheroes!
Oh, I know! The geoglyph! This is a replica of the geoglyph on the hill!

I’m Ball Guy! I’m here to cheer everyone on, whether they want me to or not!
It’s the Ball Guy! Who are you on the inside?
Aaah! A Poké Ball monster!
I feel like Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)] has a balanced team, but [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she doesn’t have any way to decisively win, you know?
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ll remember your name from now on! I’ve always loved how decisive your party is!
I guess the Champion’s going to extend his winning streak again.
The unbeatable Champion was defeated, and a new Champion was born. We got to witness history being made!
Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Remember, the Semifinals and Finals are just speed bumps on your way to facing Leon. You have to win!
You made it to the Champion Cup! That’s amazing! You really are a powerful challenger now, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Everyone in Galar wants to see what you can do!
You made it all the way to the Championship Match! You can’t lose now! You have to win, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You have to beat the unbeatable Leon and bring a new era to Galar!
It’s the great Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I was the first one to see you had the potential to become Champion! Maybe I can become a Trainer trainer some day since I’m so good at discovering talent! Hee hee... I’m just joking. Seriously though, congratulations! I’m so happy for you!
Ba ba bug!
E-excuse me, but... could I get a handshake?
Of course!
It’d be my pleasure
Th-thank you so much! I’m never going to forget this!
I’m a huge fan, Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I want to become as strong as you someday!
So [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she made it this far, huh.
I wonder who’ll win?
I can’t tell who’s going to finally win!
Oh, it’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! So cool...
It’s Challenger [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Give it your best shot! No regrets!
The whole world is watching this match!
It’s the new Champion! Your battle had me in tears!
Oh my goodness! It’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Let’s go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let’s go!
You can do it!
You’ve got to beat Leon! You just have to!
[VAR 1003][VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
We’re counting on you to keep the Galar region nice and lively, Champion!
Until the emergency in Hammerlocke settles down, there’s nothing we can do...

At last, it’s time for the final match of the Semifinals... Who could’ve imagined that the two Trainers endorsed by the Champion will battle in the final match... When you’re ready, please head for the pitch.
It’s the opening ceremony for the Finals! When you’re ready, please head for the pitch.
The final match for the Semifinals is about to begin! The ones who’ll battle in this final match are Challengers [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Hop. Both are endorsed by the Champion!

Going to the Wild Area is a snap if you use the Flying Taxis!
If you want to heal up your Pokémon, there’s nothing like setting up your camp and cooking them a good meal. Here, you can add this Berry to the pot!
If you ever come across a tent, check it out to join the camp of whoever set it up. If you’d like, you’re welcome to visit my camp too—it’s this one right here!
If your precious Pokémon get injured, don’t forget to heal them up with a Potion! And you need Antidotes to fix up poison. Just remember to stock up on items, and you won’t have to visit Pokémon Centers so often!

Even if your Pokémon are doing just fine, there’s nothing wrong with setting up your tent and having a little cookout!
If your Pokémon are a bit low on energy, set up your tent and give them some food!
Camping with your Pokémon, playing together, cooking together... these are all great ways to become closer with your Pokémon. You’re welcome to stop by my camp, too, if you’d like!

What is the problem with those Team Yell goons? I can understand wanting to cheer someone on, but they cause so much trouble in the process! Hardly a decent way for fans to behave.
That big building you see in the distance is Hammerlocke Stadium! You’re going to battle there, too!
The secret to preparing an amazing meal is stirring it just right, over the perfect heat! You know you’re doing great if the top of the pot starts sparkling. Why not stop by my camp and practice cooking a bit?

Oh? Welcome. Is there anything you’d like to know about?
Is there anything else you’d like to know about?
Here at the Pokémon Nursery, we take care of the Pokémon that Trainers leave with us. The Pokémon we look after won’t get strong, but if you leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Pokémon Eggs. If you want to leave your Pokémon with us, please speak to my granddaughter outside.
If you put a Pokémon Egg in your party and carry it around, a Pokémon will hatch from the Egg. Nobody knows where Pokémon Eggs come from. They truly are mysterious...
If you want to find Pokémon Eggs, think about the two Pokémon you leave here. I recommend you leave two of the same species of Pokémon with different genders. If the species are similar, we may still find a Pokémon Egg. But it seems we never find Eggs with certain combinations of Pokémon left here.
Please come again.
Tell me about the Pokémon Nursery
Tell me about Pokémon Eggs
Tell me about what Pokémon I should leave
Nope

They are carvings of the Pokémon Diglett. They are easy to carve due to its simple design.

Looks like your sweet [VAR PKNAME(0001)] might be running on empty. Let’s have you rest up.[VAR 0114(0008)]
As long as you have Pokémon at your side and the energy to carry onward, you’ll naturally find that you always have a smile on your face![VAR 0114(0008)]
What a frightful situation this has become... Still, I suppose everything will be all right as long as we’ve got Leon taking care of it... And you wish to help him as well, don’t you? Don’t worry—I’m certain you’ll be of some help![VAR 0114(0008)]
I suppose there must be many demands on you, love, now that you’re Champion... But remember: the important thing is that you be the kind of Champion you want to be.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Master Ball’s guaranteed to catch any Pokémon in one try, right?! That’s amazing! I bet you’ll run into a Pokémon that’ll deserve such an amazing Poké Ball one of these days![VAR 0114(0008)]
Professor Magnolia mentioned something unbelievable the other day. She said that Dynamaxing doesn’t actually make the Pokémon itself grow bigger! But they’re still able to physically interact with others, right? They must really hold an amazing amount of power![VAR 0114(0008)]
By the way, have you been to the Battle Tower in Wyndon? Leon’s mother was saying he’s been having a proper ball![VAR 0114(0008)]
Grugum?
Omgom.
Grooong!
Grzzzzzz...

It’s the television that Mum uses to watch her comedy-dramas.
It’s a fireplace that’s built into the house. It keeps things warm in the harshest winter.
Munchlax leaves leftovers around its bed from time to time.
The fridge is filled with food your family likes.
Munchlax will come to eat any leftover food, so the sink is sparkling clean.
It’s a state-of-the-art microwave oven that Mum insisted on buying.
It’s the bed you went to buy as a family. It’s super comfy and puts you to sleep instantly.
The latest video game console is sitting by the telly.
It’s a simple desk that you can keep using even when you become an adult!
There are lots of books and magazines about Pokémon neatly lined up.
It’s a plush of the Pokémon Eevee! It’s super soft to the touch!
It’s a plush of the Pokémon Pikachu! It’s super soft to the touch!
It’s a brand-new telly. Your mum bought it so that you could use your game console.

It’s one of the TVs that Hop always watches the Champion’s matches on.
There are books about the Champion.
It’s a family-size fridge that can store a lot of food.
This kitchen is always kept clean.
All these trophies belong to the Champion.
Meeeow!
To Hop, his brother is a superhero.
Even though Leon is no longer the Champion, he’s still a superhero to Hop. Now that both are Trainers, Hop must’ve realized Leon is even greater than he’d imagined.
You know, the last time Leon came round, he actually took his time to enjoy a meal with us... It’s been ages since I’ve seen him like that! Maybe we should all get together for another barbecue again sometime!

It’s one of the TVs that Hop always watches the Champion’s matches on.
The sheets are very wrinkled.
The top shelves are filled with books that seem to be hard to understand. Only adults read those types of books.
It’s a perfectly made bed. It doesn’t seem to have been used for a long time.
It’s a well-used training machine. Pokémon probably can use it, too.
They’re posters of the top three most popular Pokémon in Galar!
There’s a collection of various caps.
Leon is so busy that he hardly comes home. But I would like to keep his room clean and tidy.
Although Leon is no longer the Champion, he’s still very busy and hardly comes back. But I think he should do whatever he wants to do while he’s young.
There is a Poké Ball with a Charmander in it.
You read the letter attached to the Poké Ball...
“If you’re reading this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]... then I’m leaving this special Charmander to you! Let’s have a real fiery battle again soon! Best, Leon”
There’s no room for another Pokémon.

You see that house in the distance, with the purple roof? That’s where the Pokémon Professor lives.
Having a meal with your Pokémon makes the food taste extra good!
I heard that Leon has a younger brother... I bet he’s an amazing Trainer, just like Leon!
All around here is just quiet countryside, but wait until you see a big city. It’ll take your breath away!
Pokémon become stronger by battling. But how you raise them is where you get to show off your skills as a Trainer.
Leon’s just amazing! He’s a superstar to everyone!
The Charizard pose! Just doing the pose along with Leon makes me feel like I’ve gotten stronger!
In the morning, my Pokémon wakes me up, and in the evening, I put my Pokémon to bed... I can’t imagine a life without Pokémon!
I’ve just remembered what the sign here used to say. “To the right is the Pokémon Lab. On the opposite side is the station.”
I used to want to be a professional Pokémon Trainer when I grow up! But I can’t think about Pokémon day in and day out, the way Leon does...
It’s fun to do some shopping in a boutique! Even just getting a new hat can change your whole look!
If you’re looking for the Pokémon Professor, you can usually find her at her lovely home by the lake, enjoying the slow life.
Basics for Pokémon Trainers, lesson one! The Pokémon at the top of your team will be the first one to enter battle!
If you ever get lost during your travels, don’t forget your trusty Town Map!
I saw Leon at the station! He had such a powerful presence, I recognized him before he even got close!

Basics for Pokémon Trainers, lesson two! Don’t forget to record your progress often! Basics for Pokémon Trainers, lesson three! If a Pokémon uses a move that matches its type, the move’s power increases!
In order to bring out the full strength of their Pokémon, Trainers must be knowledgeable!
I saw Hop sneaking off toward the station.
Gah?!
The Champion’s here!
The ultimate Charizard!

It’s a plant with a gentle fragrance. Pokémon probably like it, too.
When the fireplace isn’t in use, Pokémon come in and out through the chimney.
It’s a fridge with some scratches on it. Did Pokémon try to open it?
There are a lot of books that look difficult to understand. Some of them are collections of Professor Magnolia’s research.
Do what plants would want instead of what you want. If you keep that in mind, plants will grow.

“Regarding the Changes Pokémon Can Undergo” Pokémon do not only change in appearance when they level up. They can also do so through the use of certain items or under the influence of the area they are in, in some cases. It is hypothesized that some factor within the Pokémon itself is what allows for these changes to their form and biology, but thus far, conclusive evidence of such a factor has not been found by researchers.
“What Is the Dynamax Phenomenon?” This phenomenon, in which Pokémon take on gigantic forms, has only been observed in the Galar region. Moreover, it only seems to occur in specific locations and under set conditions.
“On the Gigantification of Pokémon” While the general principal holds that Pokémon grow stronger and larger by evolving, it is also true that simply making oneself appear larger is another survival strategy with merit.

Milo does more than just work the fields. He raises beautiful flowers, too!

If you’ve never seen it before, you should really go see the amazing scenery from the hilltop. In fact, you should go see it again even if you have seen it before.
That geoglyph... I heard nobody knows its name. Maybe it was a forbidden name or something...
I took a photo of the geoglyph, but it just doesn’t compare to seeing it yourself. Still, looking at the photo is enough to bring back a rush of emotions!
How can a geoglyph drawn ages ago last for so long without eroding away? It’s so perplexing! If I think too much about it, I won’t be able to sleep.
You know what I think? I think the geoglyph was created with the help of Pokémon.
I wanna stick my head into the photo stand-in when I grow taller!
Such mysterious stone structures... Were they made by people...or by Pokémon?
If you don’t take proper care of your equipment, it can fail you when you really need it.
Route 5 is really long... It feels good to speed through it, though!

Why does Nessa love the lighthouse so much...?
Galar is a huge island. Lighthouses have always been really important in helping ships find their way.
When you see one of those giant Pokémon while fishing in the Wild Area, it feels like it’s either catch or be caught!
Nessa’s really stoic about Pokémon. She’s made her Gym mission really tough!
I remember when I did the Gym Challenge... I never did get the Water Badge.
I’ve got high hopes for you! I mean, I say that to every challenger, of course.
Freshly harvested veggies! Look good, don’t they? Freshly gathered Berries! I guess they look good?
Mistakes aren’t that bad when you cook with your mates. At least they make for funny stories!
Galar Mine No. 2 is a good spot. It’s full of rock-solid Pokémon.

We should let the people at Ballonlea know about what happened with the mural. Let’s see now... To reach Ballonlea, you have to head through that mushroom forest.

The places where you can Dynamax your Pokémon are known as Power Spots. The Gym Stadiums of the Galar region are built on these Power Spots.
Wh-wh-what’s going on?! What’s happening at the ruins?

Muscles! No cold is too cold if you have powerful muscles to keep you warm!

There are plenty of people who enjoy Pokémon battles, even if they can’t participate in the Gym Challenge. Actually, there are people who don’t battle at all, too.

I try to remove chance from my battles as much as possible, but sometimes I still feel it all comes down to luck...

Losing a match in the city of snow really chills you to the bone, doesn’t it...?
In order to face Pokémon types you’re weak against, you will need more than courage! Careful planning and strategy are what lead to courage, after all!
Courage doesn’t do any good if it comes from the wrong strategy...
You’re getting close to the end, but don’t you go slacking off just yet!
I guess I didn’t need to worry about you slacking off at all!
Buzzzirp!

I’ve got to watch h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser matches on the news again.
Can I get an autograph? Oh, and your League Card!
Hey, I know that Trainer! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s pretty famous!
I like Kabu, but I think I’ll cheer for that Trainer now!
See? I told you [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’d do it! I’ve been a fan since forever!

Can you hear me?
Try to feel your way through... Trust your senses...
That’s it... That’s the ticket...
Take a deep breath. Focus.
It might get a bit harder to see, now...
You have to carry on, not knowing what lies before you.
Feeling nervous yet? Your heart is pounding, isn’t it?
No hesitation. Your only choice is forward.
That’s a dead end, I’m afraid.
Failure opens your eyes to things you couldn’t see before.
Don’t let yourself slip up now. Not this close to the end.
You did...wonderfully. Just wonderfully.
Now, Gym Challenger. Join me on the pitch.
Tsk, tsk! No rubbing your eyes!

Stay calm and move forward.
Good, good!
Steel your nerves!
Now, enter a world of silver snow!
Trust in yourself and push forward!
Don’t rush it.
Only a little farther now. Come on—concentrate!
Oh dear, are you lost?
If you hurry, you’ll only end up going in circles.
There’s no giving up— not even at the very end!
Splendid, you’ve done well!
Come on, then. Puff out your chest a bit!
You aren’t frozen. See?

Even the same hairstyle can look completely different on different people.
I change my hair, and then I have to update my League Card... I can’t decide on the perfect hairstyle, so I just keep doing that over and over.

Hello there! Welcome to Bob’s Your Uncle! You’re not leaving here without enjoying a delicious meal first!
Isn’t this a nice tapestry? I bought it at the antique market.
You must have a proper meal first if you want to have a proper battle!
The food here is out of this world. It’s worth coming here just for this, even if it means going out of your way!
Talking about work during a meal? What are you trying to do? Ruin your own food?
This dish is cooked to perfection! It’s juicy but not overly soft, and gives you something to really bite into! I must send the cook my compliments!
I absolutely adore watching my child eat. He looks so happy and content!
The food here really is a treat, though. I wish I could figure out how to make it at home so that my Pokémon could enjoy it with us!
It’s one of the tapestries... It shows the two heroes, but without the sword and shield...
Is it a tapestry...? It looks vaguely familiar.
It’s a portrait of the owner, Bob! It’s the face of a man who strives to cook things to perfection!

Welcome to Hotel Ionia.
Do you think we should head to Wyndon soon? I’d like to get some sightseeing in along with watching the Champion Cup.
Well, I’d like to go someplace where I can meet cute Ice-type Pokémon.
The buildings in Circhester are all built using designs that go back a loooooong time. You can feel the weight of history from them.

Only after you master basic moves can you engage in more advanced battles. That’s what I learned from karate.
I heard that some wild Pokémon soak in hot springs to heal their injured bodies.

You’re welcome to stay at either building of Hotel Ionia.
Hotels are the best. No need to worry about cleaning or laundry or anything.
We’ve got tickets for the very-front-row seats in the stadium! Sometimes moves can come flying our way, but it’s wicked exciting!
I’m waiting for someone... My Noibat’s using its ultrasonic waves to help look.

Even a run-down place like this is important for the people and Pokémon who live here.
I won’t quit Team Yell! I’ll keep cheerin’ for Marnie!
I’m a huge fan of Piers. I’d really fancy seeing him in more matches.
At the end of the day, this place’d be more lively if there were more Gym Challengers.
Speaking of Piers, he refuses to Dynamax his Pokémon! But the chairman tried to move the Gym to a kinda faraway place near a Power Spot.
Closing the shutter to sabotage the other challengers was right poor sportsmanship.
Pokémon’ve got to work hard for a Gym Trainer like me to do well. Cheers, mates!
Heheheee!

[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated Piers. [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s somethin’.

Piers... He’s not a big fan of Chairman Rose, but he really loves Gym Challenges.
Any Trainer who’s made it all the way to Spikemuth’s got a right wicked look to them!

The Wild Area is a great spot to train your Pokémon, but that’s not all... It’s also the perfect place to hone your skills as a Trainer, too!
You’ll encounter more-powerful Pokémon the farther you go into the Wild Area. Be careful not to go farther than you can handle!
Time to do some camping! It’s even more fun when your mates join you!
